[[compiling-or-building-the-documentation]]
=== Compiling or building the documentation

The following procedure assists with building (or compiling) the documentation locally. Tiny recommends testing and reviewing changes locally prior to submitting a pull request.

[[installing-prerequisites]]
==== Installing Prerequisites

[[linux-users]]
===== Linux users

You need the following programs installed on your computer:

* Ruby version 2 or later. To verify the installed version, run:
+
```
ruby --version
```

. Install git, g{pp}, `make`, and the zlib development files. For example:
 ** On Fedora, run:
+
```
sudo dnf install git-all gcc-c++ make zlib-devel
```

 ** On Ubuntu, Debian or their derivatives, run:
+
```
sudo apt install git gcc cpp make zlib1g-dev
```
. Install Ruby Nokogiri: \https://nokogiri.org/
+
```
 sudo gem install nokogiri
```
. Install Ruby Bundler. Install using:
+
```
 sudo gem install bundler
```
. (optional) Docker

[[windows-users]]
===== Windows users

If you are a Windows user, follow these steps to work on TinyMCE documentation:

. Install https://gitforwindows.org/[git for Windows].
. Install https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/[Ruby+Devkit].
. Run the following command on a command prompt to install Ruby Bundler:
+
```
 gem install bundler
```

[[mac-os-users]]
===== Mac OS users

. Ruby version 2 or later is required. Verify the pre-installed version, using:
+
```
 ruby --version
```

. Install Ruby Bundler, using:
+
```
 gem install bundler
```

[[first-time-set-up]]
==== First time set up

Once you have installed any missing prerequisites, in a terminal or on a command prompt:

. Clone the git repository:
+
```
 git clone git@github.com:tinymce/tinymce-docs.git
```

. Change directory into the cloned git repository:
+
```
 cd tinymce-docs
```

. Run the initialization script to install dependencies and create the required local files in the git repository:
+
```
 ./_scripts/init.sh
```

[[run-the-development-version-of-the-documentation]]
==== Run the development version of the documentation

To create a development version of the documentation, run:
```
./_scripts/serve.sh
```

Allow the `serve.sh` script to run in the background while you are working on the TinyMCE documentation.

To view the documentation; in a web browser, navigate to http://localhost:4000/[\http://localhost:4000/].

NOTE: The development version of the documentation will update automatically when you save changes locally.

[[tinymce-api-documentation]]
==== TinyMCE API documentation

The TinyMCE API documentation is maintained within the https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce[TinyMCE project repository] and compiled for the documentation site using https://github.com/tinymce/moxiedoc[MoxieDoc].

[[prerequisites]]
===== Prerequisites

* https://nodejs.org/en/[NodeJS].
* The TinyMCE documentation repository set up for development as described in <<installing-prerequisites,Installing Prerequisites>> and <<first-time-set-up,First time set up>>.

[[installing-moxiedoc]]
===== Installing MoxieDoc

To install MoxieDoc, run:

```
npm install -g git://github.com/tinymce/moxiedoc.git
```

[[run-the-development-version-of-the-documentation-for-the-current-tinymce-version]]
===== Run the development version of the documentation for the current TinyMCE version

. Download the TinyMCE version in the `.api-version` file in this project's root directory and extract the API documentation using:
+
```
 ./_scripts/api-reference.sh
```

. Start the development server using:
+
```
 ./_scripts/serve.sh
```

[[run-the-development-version-of-the-documentation-for-a-local-tinymce-repository]]
===== Run the development version of the documentation for a local TinyMCE repository

. Extract the API documentation from a local copy of the TinyMCE repository using:
+
```
 ./_scripts/api-reference-local.sh <path/to/the/tinymce/repo>
```

. Start the development server using:
+
```
 ./_scripts/serve.sh
```

. To include updates made to the TinyMCE API documentation in the TinyMCE repository, run the `api-reference-local` script:
+
```
 ./_scripts/api-reference-local.sh <path/to/the/tinymce/repo>
```

NOTE: The development server does not need to be stopped prior to running the `api-reference-local` script.

[[codepens]]
=== Codepens

Codepens can be added to content using the "codepen" macro, such as:

```
codepen::basic-example[]
```

There are several options for this include file - please see codepen.html for details.

The source for each CodePen is store in the `_includes/codepens/` directory.

[[overriding-the-tinymce-url-in-codepens]]
==== Overriding the tinymce URL in codepens

All codepens usually get their tinymce.min.js URL from the `codepen_url` setting in the _config.yml file.
However, there are some instances where you wish to override this, e.g.

* You want to push/deploy a branch for a new feature that's only on the 'dev' channel.
* You want to run the site locally, but test out the codepens in a different channel.

To help with this, there are two mechanisms for overriding the tinymce.min.js URL.

. Set `codepen_url` in `_config-local-override.yml`.
 ** This will override the `codepen_url` setting in `config.yml`.
 ** This file is _not_ intended to be checked in.
 ** This option changes the URL for all codepens.
. Set the `script_url_override` setting when including `codepen.adoc`.
 ** This is useful if you want to deploy the develop branch for a feature only in the 'dev' channel.
 ** This only overrides the URL for one codepen.
 ** Don't use this in more than one codepen on a page.
 ** Don't use this long-term - when the feature is fully rolled-out, use the standard channel.
 ** See `codepen.adoc` for details.

NOTE: Jekyll is pretty bad at automatically reloading code when you're playing with include files.
Sometimes you need to restart the server.

[[why-is-html-minification-disabled]]
=== Why is HTML minification disabled?

It's very slow and the minifier is using regex to parse HTML. We may add a different minifier in the future.

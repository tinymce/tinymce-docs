### Supported algorithms

{{pluginname}} does not support symmetrical encryption algorithms, such as HS256. {{site.companyname}} recommends using the RS256 algorithm. The following algorithms are supported:

- RS256
- RS384
- RS512
- PS256
- PS384
- PS512

For details on each of these algorithms, visit: [RFC 7518, JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) Section 3 - Cryptographic Algorithms for Digital Signatures and MACs](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-3).

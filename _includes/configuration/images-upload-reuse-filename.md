## `images_reuse_filename`

By default {{site.productname}} will generate unique filename for each uploaded file (for details refer to [Upload Images]({{ site.baseurl }}/general-configuration-guide/upload-images/#imageuploaderrequirements)). Sometimes this might have undesirable side-effects. For example, ,when `automatic_uploads` is enabled, every manipulation on the image done with [Image Tools]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/opensource/imagetools) plugin, results in file upload and each time under a different filename, despite the fact that the image stays the same.

Setting `images_reuse_filename` to *true* tells {{site.productname}} to use the actual filename of the image, instead of generating a new one each time. Take into account that `src` attribute of the corresponding `<img>` tag gets replaced with whatever filename you send back from the server (see [images_upload_url](#images_upload_url)). It can be the same filename or something else, but the next time that filename is used for the upload.

**Type:** `Boolean`

**Default Value:** `false`

**Possible Values:** `true`, `false`

### Example: Using `images_reuse_filename`

```js
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  automatic_uploads: true,
  images_upload_url: 'postAcceptor.php',
  images_reuse_filename: true
});
```

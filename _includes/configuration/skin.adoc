== skin

This option allows you to specify the skin that {{site.productname}} should use. The default skin included with {{site.productname}} is named "oxide".

*Type:* `String`

The name of the skin should match the name of the folder within the skins directory of {{site.productname}}. If the specified skin is not found, {{site.productname}} will not load.

`js
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  skin: "oxide"
});
`

If you would like to create your own skin, please see the guide link:{{ site.baseurl }}/advanced/creating-a-skin/[here].

TinyMCE tries to be as flexible to your project's needs as possible. We have a customized package builder [available here](http://archive.tinymce.com/download/custom_package.php) where you can select the core, plugins, skins, themes and compression options you'd like to include in your download.

If you selected the standalone core option in your custom build follow the [SDK](#sdkinstall) install instructions; if you built the jQuery core option follow the [jQuery](#jqueryinstall) instructions.

> Once you have the editor installed, move on to the next step [Work with Plugins](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs-3x/api/work-with-plugins/), where you'll start customizing TinyMCE.

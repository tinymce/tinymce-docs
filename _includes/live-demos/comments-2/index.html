    <h2>Welcome to Tiny Comments!</h2>
    <p>Please try out this demo of our new Tiny Comments premium plugin.  Just highlight the content you want to add a comment to, click the Comment icon in the toolbar, type your comment into the text field at the bottom of the Comment sidebar, and click ‘Start’. Your comment is then attached to the text, <span class="mce-annotation" data-mce-annotation-uid="96pewyxd0h5" data-mce-annotation="tinycomments">exactly like this!</span></p>

    <p>If you want to take Tiny Comments for a test drive in your own environment, Tiny Comments is one of the premium plugins you can try for free for 30 days by signing up for a Tiny account. Make sure to check out our documentation as well.</p>

    <p>And if you are ready to buy, you can either purchase Tiny Comments a la carte or as part of your Tiny Pro subscription. If you are a current cloud user, Tiny Comments has already been added to your key, and if you are a self-hosted user, Tiny Comments is now available in the latest download which you can access in My Account.</p>

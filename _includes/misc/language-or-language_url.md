There are two options for changing the language of the {{site.productname}} user interfaces: `language` and `language_url`. {{site.companyname}} recommends using the `language` option for language packs bundled with the product or included in your cloud subscription. Community translations, custom language pack, or third-party language packs should be included using the `language_url` option to simplify updating and upgrading {{site.productname}}.

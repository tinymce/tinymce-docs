A [secure context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts) is required for this feature. Browsers only activate their secure context when using a web server set up for HTTPS (or development servers accessed using the localhost). Modern browsers [restrict many new features to secure contexts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts/features_restricted_to_secure_contexts).

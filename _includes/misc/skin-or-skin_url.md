There are two options for applying a skin to {{site.productname}}: `skin` and `skin_url`. {{site.companyname}} recommends using the `skin` option for skins bundled with the product or included in your cloud subscription. Custom or third-party skins should be included using the `skin_url` option to simplify updating and upgrading {{site.productname}}.

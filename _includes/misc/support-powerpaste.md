#### HTML Cleaning

On all browsers, PowerPaste provides basic HTML cleaning. For browsers where HTML5 support is not available, PowerPaste uses the browser DOM to import and clean HTML. This mechanism is the primary cleaning method on browsers where HTML5 clipboard APIs are not available. While the resulting content is clean HTML the direct conversion to a browser DOM can result in some loss of content structure and/or formatting information.

#### Improved HTML Cleaning

On browsers that support HTML5 APIs, PowerPaste is able to use improved HTML cleaning techniques.  Improved HTML cleaning uses the HTML5 clipboard APIs to access the clipboard directly. The original document structure and formatting (when importing formatting) is more likely to be preserved. Where available this approach gives the highest fidelity copy and paste from Microsoft Word to HTML.

#### Image Import

On browsers that support HTML5, PowerPaste is able to import images embedded in the content (e.g. from Microsoft Word) into the editor.  These images can then be uploaded via a HTTP post as required.

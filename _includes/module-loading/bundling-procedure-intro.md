The following procedure will assist with bundling {{installtype}} version of {{site.productname}} with {{bundler}} using {{syntax}}. The procedure assumes the user has experience with {{bundler}} and {{syntax}}. The following steps provide a working example for bundling a basic {{site.productname}} configuration with {{bundler}}, and provides links to reference pages at the end of the procedure for bundling additional customizations with the editor.

If {{site.productname}} will be used with a JavaScript framework (such as React.js, Angular, or Vue.js) the bundle will also require the relevant framework integration package (where available). For a list of supported framework integrations, see: [Integrate with other projects]({{site.baseurl}}/getting-started/install-setup/self-hosted/).

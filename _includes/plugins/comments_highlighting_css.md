## Configuring the commented text properties

The highlight styles are now a part of the overall content skin and are changed through customizing the skin.

{{site.productname}} open source project [oxide](https://github.com/tinymce/oxide/blob/master/src/less/theme/content/comments/comments.less) (default skin), defines the variables used for changing the annotation colours.

Refer to the [documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/advanced/creating-a-skin/#creatingaskin) for building a skin using this repo.

For more information on configuring {{site.productname}} formats, refer to the [formats]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/content-formatting/#formats) section.

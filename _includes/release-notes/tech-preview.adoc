TinyMCE Release Candidate 2 is a technology preview. Technology previews provide a way to access the upcoming technological innovations. The technology preview is created as a courtesy to the community of developers and the community of users to get feedback and make this technology better. In the process of making these previews generally available, Tiny endeavors to resolve all the issues reported by customers or internal and external developers.

It is important to note that these "Tech Previews" are not fully supported under the Tiny Cloud https://about.tiny.cloud/legal/tiny-cloud-services-subscription-agreement/[service level agreements]. These previews are not recommended for deployment in production and are for testing purposes only.

Please provide feedback or https://support.tiny.cloud/hc/en-us/requests/new[contact us] for support.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|:----:|----|
| `userId` | `string` | This is the user's unique ID (the `sub` field from their [JWT](({{site.baseurl}}/rtc/jwt-authentication/)), which is also used for [`rtc_user_details_provider`](#rtc_user_details_provider)). Multiple connection events will be received with the same user ID if a user opens multiple sessions (for example on desktop and mobile). |
| `userDetails` | `object` | This is a copy of the object returned by [`rtc_user_details_provider`](#rtc_user_details_provider). RTC only uses the `fullName` field, but the entire object will be cloned and passed to `rtc_client_connected`.<br/><br/>If a user details provider is not configured, this will be an empty object. |
| `clientId` | `string` | This is a unique identifier, generated by the RTC protocol, that can be used to differentiate between the same user connecting multiple times. |
| `caretNumber` | `integer` | This will be a number between 1 and 8, corresponding to one of [the 8 colors defined in TinyMCE CSS](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/blob/master/modules/oxide/src/less/theme/content/rtc/rtc.less#L1-L8). TinyMCE supports 8 distinct caret colors. If more than 8 clients connect to a session, the numbers will be reused.<br/><br/>A custom skin is required to change these colors, and no more than 8 are supported in this release. For information on creating a custom skin, see: [Customizing the Editor UI]({{site.baseurl}}/general-configuration-guide/customize-ui/). |
| `clientInfo` | `object` | This is a copy of the [`rtc_client_info`](#rtc_client_info) data from the remote user's editor configuration.<br/><br/>If none was configured, this will be an empty object. |

## How to contribute to TinyMCE's documentation

**TL;DR** A quick way to improve the docs is to click the "Was this article helpful?" and select "no". Then if you want to help more click the "opening an issue" link and submit a GitHub issue.

### So, how can you help?

We welcome people with technical writing experience to help make TinyMCE's docs as useful to our community as possible. You don't need to be an expert developer to contribute, but a basic understanding of software development is helpful.

What is more important is your ability to articulate complex ideas. Our goal is to help developers understand TinyMCE functionality as quickly as possible so that they can build great stuff.

If that sounds like something you are into, branch the [docs GitHub repository](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce-docs) and submit a PR, or reach out to the [TinyMCE docs team](mailto:marketing@tiny.cloud) if you have a specific question.

### TinyMCE docs tech stack

The documentation is built with Jekyll. Text files are written in [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) and published on [GitHub](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce-docs). You'll find the [repo here](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce-docs).

### Markdown & code syntax

As we mentioned above, we write using [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/). If you're not familiar with Markdown [read this](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/).

##### Highlighting

We highlight code language syntax and associated elements within an open and closing backtick. For example, this `object` is actually enclosed with backticks like this: \`object\`.

We cannot cover every use case here and contributors need to use their best judgment. As a rule, words relating specifically to executable parts of software languages. What is more important is your ability to articulate complex ideas. Our goal keys and their values when pertaining to objects and methods (particularly the case with TinyMCE) should have  backticks.

##### Code snippets

Code snippets should always be complete, executable code blocks starting with the `tinymce` object. We write code snippets by enclosing the example code within three opening and closing backticks. The first set of backticks is immediately followed by the code's language, which helps correct syntax highlighting: typically, html, css, js (and sometimes php).

Include any key values pairs and method options that are required to enable a user to test the snippet in a local HTML file. You do not need to include the `html` surrounding the `tinymce` object that would be required to make the snippet work. 

For example, this is good:

```js
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  plugins: 'codesample',
  toolbar: 'codesample'
});
```

This is not:

```js
tinymce.init({
  ...
  plugins: 'codesample',
  toolbar: 'codesample'
  ...
});
```

##### URLs and links

Resources to be linked take the form of placing the linked text between brackets and the URL between parenthesis. Linking an external resource looks like this:

```html
hello, [text to link](http://www.example.com) to the URL example.com.
```

We will provide the internal linking structure shortly. Otherwise, clone and branch the repo and explore for yourself (it's a test of skill).

##### Adding meta to a pages

Every page should have a meta section starting at line 1 containing information that is both informative and system critical. If you are creating a page or editing one that currently has inadequate meta information, please read the comments next to the default meta fields below.

```
---                // Three dashes at the start and end of the meta section, must be included.
layout: default    // In most cases leave this as 'default'.
title:             // The nav.yml references this so it must be included and it should be short.
title_nav:         // Descriptive title for the navigation bar, if omitted nav defaults to title field.
description_short: // Short description for the grid layouts.
description:       // Detailed description at page level for the header section under the title.
keywords:          // Space-separated list of keywords in the content.
---
```

### Style Guide

##### TinyMCE v. tinymce

Use the capitalized version of TinyMCE when referring to the open source project or the editor as an all-encompassing whole. Use lowercase when referring to the `tinymce` JavaScript object.

##### Title capitalization

For H1 titles use "Title Case Capitalization". For H2-H6 titles use "Sentence case capitalization". Sentence case capitalization is typically more comfortable to read in technical documentation like ours.

##### Spelling

Use United States English. For example, behavior rather than behavior, referring rather than referring.

##### Proper names

When referring to the name of a development language we use the proper name or, where appropriate, the industry convention. For example, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, React, AngularJS (not HTML, css, Jquery or React-js.)

The exception to this rule is when we are talking about the code itself (see the note above about TinyMCE v. tinymce). For example, we would write, "HTML is great" when talking about the HTML language, but we would write, "escape your `html`" when talking about action with/within a codebase. We realize this can be a little confusing, so do what you think makes sense, and we will review it with your PR.

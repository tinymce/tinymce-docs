{{ site.productname }} supports some browser-native events, and provides additional events for working with the editor and plugins.

## Handling Editor events

The following examples illustrate how to use supported native events, editor core events, and plugin events with {{ site.productname }}.

The following example uses a function to create a console log entry when the editor has initialized. This is also an example of handling an event which does not return any data.

```js
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',
  setup: function(editor) {
    editor.on('init', function(e) {
      console.log('The Editor has initialized.');
    });
  }
});
```

The following example uses a function to create a console log entry when a command is executed in the editor. This is also an example of handling an event that returns data.

```js
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',
  init_instance_callback: function(editor) {
    editor.on('ExecCommand', function(e) {
      console.log('The ' + e.command + ' command was fired.');
    });
  }
});
```

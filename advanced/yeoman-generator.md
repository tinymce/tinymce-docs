{{site.companyname}} maintains a [Yeoman generator]({{ site.baseurl }}/advanced/yeoman-generator/) to help make plugin creation for {{site.productname}} easier. The Yeoman Generator will create the files and boilerplate code required for a custom plugin, and sets up some helpful commands. 


## Install the generator
The plugin generator is built with the project scaffolding tool [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/). To get started install both `yo` (the yeoman command) and the generator with the following command:

```sh
npm install --global yo generator-tinymce
```

Wait for the install to finish.

## Run the generator
Start the generator with the following command:


```sh
yo tinymce
```

You will then be guided through these questions:

1. **Plugin name?**  
The name of the plugin.
2. **How do you want to write your plugin?**  
With what technology do you want to write your plugin? ES2015 transpiled with Babel, Typescript or the module system used internally by {{site.companyname}} called Bolt.
3. **Use yarn instead of npm?**  
Use `yarn` instead of `npm` for a speedier install.
4. **Skip git repo initialization?**  
Here you can skip the creation of a new repository for the plugin.
5. **Whatâ€™s your name?**  
For license.
6. **Your email? (optional)**  
For license.
7. **Your website? (optional)**  
For license
8. **Which license do you want to use?**  
Choose the license for the plugin.

Yeoman installs the needed dependencies, and the project is bootstrapped and ready. `cd` into the plugin directory and run the following command to start the auto-reloading development server:

```sh
npm start
```


## Create distribution ready build

Run the following command as root once you have completed development of the plugin:

```sh
npm run build
```

A `dist` directory will be created with a directory named the same as your plugin containing three files:

* `plugin.js` - unminified plugin bundle
* `plugin.min.js` - minified and uglified plugin bundle
* `LICENSE` - the text file containing your license

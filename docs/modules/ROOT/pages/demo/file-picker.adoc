:description: This example shows how to add a local file picker to the Image dialog.
:keywords: example demo image local-file-picker file_picker_callback
:title_nav: Basic local file picker

While we demonstrate how you can add local file picker to the _Image_ dialog, in order for it to be useful in the real-world scenario, you should also enable link:{rootDir}general-configuration-guide/upload-images[image uploading functionality] - as a way to transport those local images to a server.

You might also consider our link:{rootDir}plugins/moxiemanager.html[MoxieManager] module, which can hook onto `file_picker_callback` and provide feature-rich file manager UI right in the popup (check a demo http://www.moxiemanager.com/demos/tinymce.php[here]). With accompanying plugins it is possible to pick files from Dropbox, Google Drive http://www.moxiemanager.com/documentation/index.php/Plugins[and much more].

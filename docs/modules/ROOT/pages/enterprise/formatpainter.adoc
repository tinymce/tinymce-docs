The Format Painter plugin allows a user to copy and paste formatting from one location to another, such as font style and size.

The format painter retains the formatting after application making it possible to apply the same formatting multiple times by using the `Ctrl+Alt+V` keyboard shortcut.

The ability to reuse existing formatting saves the user time and ensures consistency across the content.

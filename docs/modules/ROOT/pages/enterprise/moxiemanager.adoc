== File and Image Management Using Moxie Manager

MoxieManager is a premium {productname} plugin and server system that enables users to insert files located externally to the editor (e.g. on their client desktop) into their document.

MoxieManager is an application separate from {productname} that includes .NET or PHP server components. Being built by the team behind {productname} it has tight integration with the editor via a toolbar control. It is designed to work with {productname} configuration settings such as `relative_urls`.

MoxieManager is a paid addition to {productname}. It is included in link:{pricingpage}[{enterpriseplan}].

Full documentation on MoxieManager, including how to http://www.moxiemanager.com/documentation/index.php/TinyMCE_Integration[integrate with {productname}], can be http://www.moxiemanager.com/documentation/[found] on the MoxieManager website.

// We also have a demo for you to explore the MoxieManager capabilities [here]({rootDir}/demo/moxie-manager/).

[[tinymce-2]]
=== TinyMCE

The new TinyMCE 5.0.7 editor comes with significant changes to the previous versions. Improved solutions have been introduced for unnecessary and obsolete configuration options. A comprehensive list of the updates and fixed issues is available in the link:{rootDir}changelog.html#version507june52019[changelog].

[[autocompleter]]
==== Autocompleter

The autocompleter functionality builtin to TinyMCE and used by the link:{rootDir}plugins/mentions.html[*Mentions*], link:{rootDir}plugins/charmap.html[*Charmap*] and link:{rootDir}plugins/emoticons.html[*Emoticons*] plugins, has been improved to highlight matched text results, search across fragmented text nodes and support matching results that contain one or more spaces.

For more information on the autocompleter refer to the link:{rootDir}ui-components/autocompleter.html[documentation].

[[link-plugin]]
==== Link plugin

The *Link* plugin `link_assume_external_targets` setting has been improved to allow two additional values: `http` and `https`. Using one of the new values will automatically set the protocol if not defined when creating a link, instead of asking the user if the protocol should be added.

For more information on the configuration options for `link_assume_external_targets` refer to the link:{rootDir}plugins/link.html#link_assume_external_targets[documentation].

[[known-issues]]
== Known issues

[[premium-skins-and-icon-packs-2]]
=== Premium Skins and Icon Packs

Using the cloud hosted premium content skins, in combination with the link:{rootDir}plugins/preview.html[preview] plugin, will cause nothing to render in the preview dialog. This is because the `Origin` header sent to the server is `null`, due to how the preview dialog is implemented in TinyMCE. This will be fixed in the next release of TinyMCE.

NOTE: This issue only impacts cloud and does not impact self-hosted installations.

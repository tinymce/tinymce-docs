[[tinymce-5-3-new-features-and-enhancements]]
== TinyMCE 5.3 new features and enhancements

The following new features and enhancements were added for the {productname} 5.3 release.

[[new-toolbar-location-default-setting]]
=== New toolbar location default setting

{productname} 5.3 includes a new default, `auto`, for the `toolbar_location` option. The `auto` option positions the toolbar and menu bar either:

* Above the content area by default.
* Below the content area if there is not enough space to display the toolbar and menu bar above.

This new default setting has been added to improve the user experience for the editor in inline mode.

For information on:

* The `toolbar_location` option, see: link:{rootDir}configure/editor-appearance.html#toolbar_location[User interface options - toolbar_location].
* {productname} in inline mode, see: link:{rootDir}general-configuration-guide/use-tinymce-inline.html#enablinginlineeditingmode[Setup inline editing mode].

[[moved-the-enabled-checkmark-on-toggle-menu-items-to-the-right-hand-side]]
=== Moved the 'enabled' checkmark on toggle menu items to the right-hand side

The checkmark on toggle menu items that indicates that an option is enabled, has been moved. The checkmark will now appear to the right of the menu label. This change provides clearer feedback to users and allows icons to be added to toggle menu items.
For example:

[cols="^,^"]
|===
| {productname} 5.2 toggle menu item checkmark behavior | {productname} 5.3 toggle menu item checkmark behavior

| image:old_togglemenuitemchecked.png[Custom toggle menu item with checkmark on the left-hand side of the item label (pre-5.3 behavior)]
| image:53_togglemenuitemchecked.png[Custom toggle menu item with checkmark on the right-hand side of the item label (5.3+ behavior)]
|===

For information on toggle menu items, see: link:{rootDir}ui-components/menuitems.html#togglemenuitems[Custom menu items - Toggle menu items].

[[new-find-and-replace-in-selection-functionality]]
=== New find and replace in selection functionality

A new "Find in selection" option has been added to the Find and Replace dialog provided by the Search and Replace plugin.

For example:

image::find-replace-in-selection.png[Find and Replace dialog with new "Find in selection" option highlighted]

For information on enabling the Find and Replace dialog, see: link:{rootDir}plugins/searchreplace.html[the Search and Replace plugin].

[[multiple-context-toolbars-can-now-be-concatenated]]

[[deprecated-features]]
== Deprecated features

The `images_dataimg_filter` option has been deprecated with the release of {productname} 5.3 and may be removed in a future release of {productname}. This option can be used for an unintended use-case that will likely be incompatible with the future introduction of real-time collaboration support.

=== Get help with Tiny Drive

To implement {cloudfilemanager}, you need prior knowledge of JWT in detail, including how they can be used for user authentication and session management in a web application. There will be some coding involved on both the client-side and the server-side to configure JWT as per the instructions in this section.

Getting started with {cloudfilemanager} can be tricky if you are new to JWT. We recommend reading up and trying to understand how link:{rootDir}tinydrive/jwt-authentication.html[JWT authentication] works.

If you haven't tried any of the link:{rootDir}tinydrive/getting-started.html#starterprojects[Starter projects], we recommend you try them before trying to implement your own solution. The source is also available on Github to study.

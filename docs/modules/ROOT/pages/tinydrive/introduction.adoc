{cloudfilemanager} is a premium {productname} plugin for cloud-based asset management and storage solution.

{cloudfilemanager} allows trouble-free management of assets such as images and files in the cloud. Files can be dragged and dropped to be instantly uploaded to the cloud storage using a CDN to serve the required files and images.

User can manage file uploads, storage, processing, and delivery for your website or app. All components of {cloudfilemanager} infrastructure seamlessly work as a whole, are easy to configure, and can be extremely flexible when needed.

Developers at {companyname} build the upload UI, libs, and APIs for developers. {cloudfilemanager} integrations are designed to be non-coder ready, easy to configure, and well-covered with documentation and guides.

[[demo]]
== Demo

Here is a quick demo on how {cloudfilemanager} integrates with {productname}.

codepen::drive-demo[]

[[upload-files-url]]
== Upload files URL

The URL format for each file is `+https://drive.tiny.cloud/1/{your-api-key}/{uuid}+` and gets generated when a file is uploaded.
If a file is moved or renamed, it will still have the same unique URL, so the restructuring of the files using {cloudfilemanager} won't affect where they are being used. However, deleting a file will mark the URL as being unused, and the URL will not continue to work.

[[user-specific-root]]
== User specific root

It is common to desire to be able to have user specific paths so that each user within a system gets its directory. This can be done by setting the `+https://claims.tiny.cloud/drive/root+` custom JWT claim to a path within {accountpage}. This path will automatically be constructed when the user is accessing {cloudfilemanager} using a JWT key with that claim. The user can only see and manage files within that root.

[[security-performance]]
== Security & performance

{companyname} is aware that security is a primary concern when it comes to cloud storage. As a user's assets are passed back and forth between a {productname} editor instance and the S3 bucket, {cloudfilemanager} uses the user's API key and a JSON Web Token (JWT) to authenticate each data transaction. Each {cloudfilemanager} user will need to create their own JWT.

[[jwt]]
== JWT

Some cloud services for {productname} require setting up JWT authentication. This allows verifying that the end users are allowed to access a particular feature. JWT is a common authorization solution for web services and is documented in more detail at the \https://jwt.io/ website. For more information, see the link:{rootDir}tinydrive/jwt-authentication.html[JWT authentication] section.

[[file-types]]
== File types

There is a fixed set of file extensions that you can upload and these are placed in the file type categories below. We constantly expand these sets with new file extensions. We don't allow any file type to be uploaded since some extensions are problematic from a security perspective.

* `document` - doc, xls, ppt, pps, docx, xlsx, pptx, pdf, rtf, txt, key, pages, numbers
* `audio` - wav, wave, mp3, ogg, oga, ogx, ogm, spx, opus
* `video` - mp4, m4v, ogv, webm, mov
* `image` - gif, jpeg, jpg, png, tif, tiff, bmp
* `archive` - zip

[[starter-projects]]

:description: Description of the Tiny Drive plugin api
:keywords: tinydrive api
:title_nav: Plugin API

The {cloudfilemanager} {productname} plugin has an api that enables access to {cloudfilemanager} from your custom plugins or {productname} specific integration code. This api is available though the `editor.plugins.tinydrive` property.

[[tinydrive-pick]]
== tinydrive.pick

The `tinydrive.pick` method enables you to pick files from {cloudfilemanager} and get the meta data of those files returned in a promise. For a complete list of available settings to pass in to this method check the <<pickersettings,Picker settings>> section in this page.

[[file-picker-result-format]]
=== File Picker Result Format

The `tinydrive.pick` api method will return a promise with object that has a `files` property. This `files` property is an array of files with the following properties.

[[name]]
==== name

The name of the selected file for example `my.jpg`.

[[size]]
==== size

The size in bytes of the selected file.

[[url]]
==== url

The url for the selected file would be in the following format: `+https://drive.tiny.cloud/1/<your api key>/<file uuid>+`

[[mdate]]
==== mdate

The modification date for the file in ISO 8601 format for example `2019-02-24T15:00:00Z`

[[demo]]
=== Demo

codepen::drive-plugin-pick[]

[[tinydrive-browse]]
== tinydrive.browse

The `tinydrive.browse` method enables you to browse your files stored in {cloudfilemanager} but without the possibility to pick them to be inserted. This might be useful if you want to use {cloudfilemanager} as a generic file manager. It returns a promise but the promise will only resolve when the {cloudfilemanager} dialog is closed by using the close button. For a complete list of available settings to pass in to this method check the <<pickersettings,Picker settings>> section in this page.

[[demo-2]]
=== Demo

codepen::drive-plugin-browse[]

[[tinydrive-upload]]
== tinydrive.upload

The `tinydrive.upload` method enables directly upload blobs to your {cloudfilemanager} storage. This can be useful when you want to store a file generated by your app.

[[demo-2]]
=== Demo

codepen::drive-plugin-upload[]

[[picker-settings]]
== Picker settings

These settings are available for the <<tinydrivepick,tinydrive.pick>> / <<tinydrivebrowse,tinydrive.browse>> api methods.

[[filetypes]]
=== `filetypes`

This setting enables restricting what types of files you want do display based on link:{rootDir}tinydrive/introduction.html#filetypes[file type] categories. For example if your app needs to insert images only then you can specify `['image']` in the file types array.

*Type:* `Array<string>`

[[demo-2]]
==== Demo

codepen::drive-plugin-pick-images[]

[[-2]]
=== `max_image_dimension`

This setting enables constraining the width/height of uploaded images. When this is enabled any images with a higher width or height than the specified amount would be proportionally resized down to the specified maximum dimension.

*Type:* `Number`

[[example]]
==== Example

[source,js]
----
tinydrive.pick({
  max_image_dimension: 1024

[[overview]]
== Overview

An `autocompleter` enables users to quickly find and select from a pre-populated list of values as they type, leveraging searching and filtering. It provides suggestions to insert while the user is typing into the content. For example, with the link:{rootDir}plugins/charmap.html[charmap] plugin enabled, typing *:amp* should show the ampersand item in the menu. Pressing `esc` should close the autocomplete menu.

== How to create custom autocompleters

The method for adding a custom autocompleter is in the *UI Registry* part of the editor API `editor.ui.registry`:

* `editor.ui.registry.addAutocompleter(name, configuration)`

The two arguments this method take are:

* `name` - A unique name for the autocompleter.
* `configuration` - An object containing the user's configuration.

[[configuration-options]]
=== Configuration options

|===
| Name | Value | Requirement | Description

| ch
| string
| Required
| The character to trigger the autocompleter.

| fetch
| `+(pattern: string, maxResults: number, fetchOptions: Record<string, any>) => Promise<AutocompleterItem[]>+`
| Required
| A function that is passed the current matched text pattern, the maximum number of expected results and any additional fetch options. The function should return a promise containing matching results.

| onAction
| `+(api, rng: Range, value: string) => void+`
| Required
| A function invoked when a fetched item is selected.

| columns
| number or 'auto'
| Optional
| default: auto - The number of columns to show. If set to `1` column, then icons and text are displayed, otherwise only icons are displayed.

| matches
| `+(rng: Range, text: string, pattern: string) => boolean+`
| Optional
| default: isStartOfWord - A predicate function that takes a range, the current text node content and the matched text content and returns a boolean indicating if the autocompleter should trigger.

| maxResults
| number
| Optional
| default: 10 - The maximum number of results that should be fetched.

| minChars
| number
| Optional
| default: 1 - The minimum number of characters that must be typed before the autocompleter will trigger (excluding the trigger char).
|===

The `fetch` function is called whenever the trigger `char` is pressed and the `matches` predicate returns `true`. It is a function that takes the matched text pattern and returns a promise containing matching results. This allows for asynchronous fetching of the autocompleter items. The `fetchOptions` passed to the `fetch` function is by default an empty object, however using the <<api,reload>> API additional options can be passed to fetch a different set of results.

The `fetch` results should be a list of objects with the following details:
* `value`: Value of the item. This will be passed to the `onAction` callback when selected.
* `text`: Text to display for the item.
* `icon`: Name of the icon to be displayed. Must be a single unicode character or correspond to an icon in the icon pack.

NOTE: If two or more autocompleters use the same trigger character, then the fetched results will be merged together before being displayed.

[[api]]
=== API

|===
| Name | Value | Description

| hide
| `+() => void+`
| Hides the autocompleter menu.

| reload
| `+(fetchOptions: Record<string, any>) => void+`
| Hides the autocompleter menu and fetches new menu items. The  `fetchOptions` will be passed to the autocompleter `fetch` callback.

== Example

This example shows how the charmap plugin adds the standard autocompleter. The autocompleter will show whenever a `:` character is typed plus at least one additional character.

A context toolbar can only contain either buttons that are defined for a normal toolbar, or buttons specifically registered for launching a link:{rootDir}ui-components/contextform.html[ContextForm]. The buttons comes as a list of strings, where each string is a registered name of a button.

== Registering a context toolbar

A context toolbar is registered by calling the `addContextToolbar` API in the registry. The specification is as follows:

|===
| Name | Description

| `predicate`
| This controls when the context toolbar will appear

| `position`
| This controls where the context toolbar will appear with regards to the current cursor

| `scope`
| This controls whether the predicate is a `node`-based predicate, or an `editor`-based predicate. See context toolbar proirity section below, for more details.

| `items`
| A list of strings which represent either a registered toolbar button, or a registered context form launcher.
|===

== Launching a context toolbar programmatically

There is an `editor` event called `contexttoolbar-show` that can be fired to show a context toolbar at the current selection. The event takes a parameter `toolbarKey` which specifies the name of the registered context form or context toolbar to show.

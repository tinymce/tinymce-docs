[[convert_urls]]
== convert_urls

This option enables you to control whether {productname} is to be smart and restore URLs to their original values. URLs are automatically converted (messed up) by default because the browser's built-in logic works this way. There is no way to get the real URL unless you store it away. If you set this option to `false` it tries to keep these URLs intact. This option is set to `true` by default, which means URLs are forced to be either *absolute* or *relative* depending on the state of <<relative_urls,relative_urls>>.

*Type:* `Boolean`

*Default Value:* `true`

*Possible Values:* `true`, `false`

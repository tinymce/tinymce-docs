[[custom_ui_selector]]
== custom_ui_selector

Use the *custom_ui_selector* option to specify the elements that you want {productname} to treat as a part of the editor UI. Specifying elements enables the editor not to lose the selection even if the focus is moved to the elements matching this selector. The `editor blur` event is not fired if the focus is moved to elements matching this selector since it's treated as part of the editor UI.

*Type:* `String`

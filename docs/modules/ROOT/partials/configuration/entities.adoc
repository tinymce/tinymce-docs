[[entities]]
== entities

This option contains a comma-separated list of entity names that are used instead of characters. Odd items are the character code, and even items are the names of the character code.

The base entities `<`, `>`, `&`, `'`, and `"` will always be entity encoded into their named equivalents. Though, `'` and `"` will only be encoded within attribute values and `<` and `>` will only be encoded within text nodes. This is correct according to the HTML and XML specifications.

_This setting will only encode characters higher than \u007E (126 in unicode)._

*Type:* `String`

[[event_root]]
== event_root

This option enables you to specify a CSS selector for an element to be used as the event root when the editor is in `inline` mode.

By default all events gets bound to the editable area. But in some implementations where the DOM gets modified you want to bind these events to a container and then delegate the events down to the right editor, based on the element ID.

*Type:* `String`

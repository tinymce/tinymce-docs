[[height]]
== height

*height* sets the height of the entire editor, including the menu bar, toolbars, and status bar.

NOTE: If a number is provided, {productname} sets the height in pixels. If a string is provided, {productname} assumes the value is valid CSS and simply sets the editor's height as the string value. This allows for alternate units such as `%`, `em`, and `vh`.

*Type:* `Number` or `String`

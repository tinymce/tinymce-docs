== init_instance_callback

The *init_instance_callback* option allows you to specify a function name to be executed each time an editor instance is initialized. The format of this function is `initInstance(editor)` where `editor` is the editor instance object reference.

*Type:* `JavaScript Function`

[discrete#example]
===== Example

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  init_instance_callback : function(editor) {
    console.log("Editor: " + editor.id + " is now initialized.");
  }
});
----

You may also want to take a look at the <<setup,setup callback option>> as it can be used to bind events before the editor instance is initialized.

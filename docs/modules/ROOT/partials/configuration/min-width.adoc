[[min_width]]
== min_width

This option allows you to set the minimum width that a user can stretch the entire {productname} interface (by grabbing the dragable area in the bottom right of the editor interface) when using the modern theme.

[NOTE]
====
Note that this behavior is different than the link:{rootDir}plugins/autoresize.html[`autoresize`] plugin, which controls the resizing of the editable area only, not the entire editor.
====

*Type:* `Number`

[discrete#example]
===== Example

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  min_width: 400
});
----

[TIP]
====
By default the <<resize,`resize`>> handle does not allow horizontal dragging and giving this key a value will not result in an observable behavior.

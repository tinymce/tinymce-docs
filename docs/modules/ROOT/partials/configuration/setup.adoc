[[setup]]
== setup

This option allows you to specify a callback that will be executed before the {productname} editor instance is rendered.

To specify a setup callback, please provide the `setup` option with a JavaScript function. This function should have one argument, which is a reference to the editor that is being set up.

A common use case for this setting is to add editor events to {productname}. For instance, if you would like to add a click event to {productname}, you would add it through the setup configuration setting.

*Type:* `JavaScript Function`

[[target]]
== target

Sometimes there might be already a reference to a DOM element at hand, for example when element is created dynamically. In such case initialising editor on it by link:{rootDir}configure/integration-and-setup.html#selector[selector] might seem irrational (since selector - _id_ or _class_ should be created first). In such cases you can supply that element directly via `target` option.

IMPORTANT: `selector` option has precedence over `target`, so in order for `target` to work, you _should_ omit `selector` option altogether.

*Type:* `Node`

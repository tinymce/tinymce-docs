[[changes-to-paste-and-paste]]
==== Changes to `clean` paste and `Remove Formatting` paste

*PowerPaste* _5.0_ included a change to the `Remove Formatting` functionality to filter out inline style elements (such as `strong`, `b`, `em`, `i`, and `sub`), in-line with other editor functionality.

*PowerPaste* _5.2_ *reverses the _5.0_ change* and includes a new `powerpaste_clean_filtered_inline_elements` setting. This setting accepts a list of inline style elements to be filtered. These inline elements will be filtered on `clean` or `Remove Formatting` paste.

To retain the _5.0_ default inline style element filter, add the following setting to `tinymce.init`:

[source,js]
----
powerpaste_clean_filtered_inline_elements: 'strong,em,b,i,u,strike,sup,sub,font'
----

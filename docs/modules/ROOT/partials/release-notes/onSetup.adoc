`onSetup` is a complex property. It takes a function that is passed the component's API and should return a callback that is passed the component's API and returns nothing. This occurs because `onSetup` runs whenever the component is rendered, and the returned callback is executed when the component is destroyed. This is essentially an `onTeardown` handler, and can be used to unbind events and callbacks.

To clarify, in code `onSetup` may look like this:

[source,js]
----
onSetup: (api) => {
  // Do something here on component render, like set component properties or bind an event listener

  return (api) => {
    // Do something here on teardown, like unbind an event listener
  };
};
----

To bind a callback function to an editor event use `editor.on(eventName, callback)`. To unbind an event listener use `editor.off(eventName, callback)`. Any event listeners _should_ be unbound in the teardown callback. The only editor event which does not need to be unbound is `init` e.g. `editor.on('init', callback)`.

[NOTE]
====
* The callback function for `editor.off()` should be the same function passed to `editor.on()`. For example, if a `editorEventCallback` function is bound to the `NodeChange` event when the button is created, `onSetup` should return `+(api) => editor.off('NodeChange', editorEventCallback)+`.
* If `onSetup` does not have any event listeners or only listens to the `init` event, `onSetup` can return an empty function e.g. `+return () => {};+`.

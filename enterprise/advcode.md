The [Advanced Code Editor]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/premium/advcode/) plugin (`advcode`) brings a more advanced code editor to {{site.productname}}. This code editor makes it easier to modify the HTML, and it's a very useful add-on for power users. It comes with many features often found in IDEs, all enabled by default:

* Syntax color highlighting
* Bracket matching
* Code folding
* Multiple selections/carets
* Search and Replace

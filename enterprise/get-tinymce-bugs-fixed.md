TinyMCE is an open source project that relies on the community, to report and fix bugs. You can do this through our [Github project](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce).

The team behind TinyMCE invests a lot of time in fixing community-reported bugs - particularly high priority issues. Just check out our [changelog]({{ site.baseurl }}/changelog/) and I am sure you will agree!

However, we cannot fix all of the issues that are reported. With 5 million downloads a year we have to triage what impacts the most people.

If your company needs specific issues fixed on a timeline, we suggest you sign up for a TinyMCE Enterprise subscription to receive priority support. Again, we cannot guarantee that we can fix all bugs, but this is the way to ensure your issues are at the top of the queue.

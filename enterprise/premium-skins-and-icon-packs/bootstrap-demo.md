This demo shows an example form using Bootstrap together with {{site.productname}} and the {{site.companyname}} _Bootstrap_ skin and _Bootstrap_ icon pack. It's designed to closely match the _colors, forms, and buttons_ of the default Bootstrap framework UI.

>The focus outline on the editor is not part of the skin. Take a look in the JS tab below for inspiration on how to add it.

This page describes:

* When the use of {{site.productname}} needs to be attributed to {{site.companyname}}.
* How to attribute {{site.productname}} to {{site.companyname}}.

## Paid Customers

If you are using {{site.productname}} on a paid tier of {{site.cloudname}} or have an active commercial license agreement, you are not required to include attribution.

## Free and Open Source Users

Users on a free tier of {{site.cloudname}} are **required** by the [Terms of Service]({{site.legalpages}}/tiny-cloud-services-subscription-agreement/) to include attribution when {{site.productname}} is shown.

As per [clause 6 of the LGPL 2.1](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/blob/develop/LICENSE.TXT#L278), users using {{site.productname}} under the LGPL are required to give prominent notice that {{site.productname}} is in use. We recommend including attribution as described below.

## Including Attribution with TinyMCE

The {{site.productname}} status bar provides the required attribution on the right-hand side.

The following example shows the status bar product attribution in the bottom, right-hand corner:

![Screenshot of homepage {{site.productname}} demo including product attribution in the bottom, right-hand corner]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tinymce5-homepage-demo.png)

If the status bar is removed or not visible on the editor, you can include attribution per the following:

* "**POWERED BY TINY**" or the [{{site.companyname}} logo]({{site.url}}/guidelines/#logo) placed in a readily visible location in your application when the editor is loaded.
* The word "**Tiny**" or the {{site.companyname}} logo should have a hyperlink to [{{site.url}}]({{site.url}}).

The location of the product attribution is to be:

* In the right-hand corner of the status bar of the {{site.productname}} editor; or
* An alternate location adjacent to the {{site.productname}} editor that is no less prominent.

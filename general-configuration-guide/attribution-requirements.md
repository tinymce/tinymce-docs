{{site.cloudname}} is available to anyone wanting to integrate {{site.productname}} into their own website or application. Use of {{site.cloudname}} is governed by the [Terms of Service](https://about.tiny.cloud/legal/tiny-cloud-services-subscription-agreement/). Among other things, these terms require adhering to specific guidelines on how branding for {{site.companyname}} must be handled. The purpose of this document is to highlight these requirements.

There is a **POWERED BY TINY** attribution in the status bar that is enabled by default for all {{site.cloudname}} users. The {{site.tieroneplan}} is meant to support small projects and give back to the community. This option cannot be disabled on a free {{site.accountpage}}. However, it is **optional** for users on other paid tiers to include attribution and link back to {{site.companyname}} via a logo or text to let the world know that their editor is powered by {{site.companyname}}.

When including attribution, the following requirements must be met:

* "**POWERED BY TINY**" to be stated or the [{{site.companyname}} logo]({{site.url}}/guidelines/#logo) placed in a readily visible location whenever the editor is loaded.
* The word "**Tiny**" or the {{site.companyname}} logo should have a hyperlink to [{{site.url}}]({{site.url}}).
* The location of the product attribution is to be:

  * In the right-hand corner of the status bar of the {{site.productname}} editor; or
  * An alternate location adjacent to the {{site.productname}} editor that is no less prominent.

The following example shows the status bar product attribution in the bottom, right-hand corner:

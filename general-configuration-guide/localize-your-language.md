{{site.productname}} makes your project accessible to the world through its simple localization framework.

This section demonstrates how to change {{site.productname}}'s user interface to the user's language preference. These settings change the language in the toolbar, menu items, buttons, and tooltips.

> **Note**: Language settings can be controlled in these configuration options: [directionality]({{ site.baseurl }}/configure/localization/#directionality), [language]({{ site.baseurl }}/configure/localization/#language) and  [language_url]({{ site.baseurl }}/configure/localization/#language_url). There is also a [Directionality plugin]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/opensource/directionality/) that adds a toolbar button to control `ltr-rtl` behavior.

## Step 1

Go to the [language download page]({{site.gettiny}}/language-packages/) to review a list of language packs available for {{site.productname}}.

Click the download link on the far right of the table for a single language. Check the box beside each language and then click the download button at the bottom of the table for multiple languages.

> **Important**: The {{site.productname}} community translation project provides the language packs on our language download page.

## Step 2

Unpack the language `js` file(s) into the `path/to/tinymce/langs/` folder.

> **Important**: The language settings will not work unless the language pack is placed in `langs/` directory. The [language_url]({{ site.baseurl }}/configure/localization/#language_url) configuration option is another method to enable additional language settings.

## Step 3

Set the language option in {{site.productname}}'s configuration to the language code in the list on [this page]({{ site.baseurl }}/configure/localization/#language).

## Step 4

Load {{site.productname}} to confirm that the language is set correctly.

## A working example

The following code snippet sets {{site.productname}}'s language to Chinese and the text directionality from right to left.

[Download the Chinese language]({{site.gettiny}}/language-packages/) pack to test this functionality. Install a *local instance* of {{site.productname}} from the [downloads page]({{site.gettiny}}). Follow the [self-hosted install instructions]({{ site.baseurl }}/general-configuration-guide/advanced-install/#self-hostedinstall).

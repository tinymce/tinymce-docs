## Using TinyMCE in a Bootstrap dialog

You need to override the built-in block on `focusin` in Bootstrap dialogs when using TinyMCE inside it. See this fiddle for a [working example](http://fiddle.tinymce.com/oxdaab).

Bootstrap blocks all focus events on contents within the dialog. Add this script to your page, and it will allow users to click inside the editor.

```js
// Prevent Bootstrap dialog from blocking focusin
$(document).on('focusin', function(e) {
  if ($(e.target).closest(".mce-window").length) {
    e.stopImmediatePropagation();
  }
});
```

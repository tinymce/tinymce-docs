[Laravel](https://laravel.com/) is a scaleable web application framework built on PHP. The following guides provide procedures for creating a new Laravel project and adding {{site.productname}} to the project.

These guides assist with adding {{site.productname}} to pages or views in Laravel. The example Laravel projects created in these procedures are based on the Laravel project documented in the Laravel Docs, under [Installation Via Composer](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/installation#installation-via-composer). These guides will create two blades: one for the JavaScript and another for the editor placeholder, to reflect how {{site.productname}} should be used in production environments.

<h2>Note on the included Templates demonstration</h2>

<p>The included Templates demonstration uses the <a class="mceNonEditable" href="{{site-url}}/tinymce/7/advanced-templates/#advtemplate_list"><code>advtemplate_list</code></a> configuration option to return a local promise containing a basic Template structure with self-contained examples.</p>

<p>This example allows for the loading of and interacting with the Template user-interface but cannot be used to create, edit, or save Template items.</p>

<p>See the <a class="mceNonEditable" href="{{site-url}}/tinymce/7/advanced-templates/">Templates</a> documentation for details on how to setup Templates to interact with external data sources.</p>

    <h1>The Incomparable Yosemite</h1>
    <p>The most famous and accessible of these ca&ntilde;on valleys,&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #fbeeb8;">and also the one that presents their most striking and sublime features on the grandest scale</span>, is the Yosemite, situated in the basin of the Merced River at an elevation of 4000 feet above the level of the sea. It is about&nbsp;<em><span style="color: #2dc26b;">seven miles long</span></em>, half a mile to a mile wide, and nearly a mile deep in the&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #f8cac6;">solid granite flank</span>&nbsp;of the range.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><em>The walls are made up of rocks</em>, mountains in size, partly separated from each other by side ca&ntilde;ons, and they are so sheer in front, and so compactly and harmoniously arranged on a level floor, that the Valley, comprehensively seen, looks like an immense hall or temple lighted from above.</p>

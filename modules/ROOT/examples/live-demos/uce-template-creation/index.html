  <h1>Process</h1>

    <p>We work closely with you to build and fulfill the project’s needs by {{completion.date}}.</p>

    <p>We do this by establishing clear goals and a comprehensive solution based on {{client.company}}’s needs.</p>

    <p>Our process is as follows.</p>
    
    <h2>Phase 1: initial consultation</h2>

    <p>Our expert team reviews any and all project-related systems and determines:<p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>existing pain points; and</li>
    <li>existing leverage opportunities.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Based on this initial consultation we develop a solutions list.</p>

    <h2>Phase 2: solution model</h2>

    <p>Working with your team we implement the selected solution.</p>

    <p>This allows us to tailor the solution specifically for {{client.company}}’s needs, ensuring the solution does not include services you do not need and should not pay for.</p>

    <h2>Phase 3: implementation</h2>

    <p>Once we have agreed on a solution, our team implements the project plan.</p>

    <p>We will first deliver a detailed outline of the plan with a timeline that includes and all relevant due dates and deliverables.</p>

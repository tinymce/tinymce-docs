[[new-and-improved-commands-and-queries]]
=== New and improved commands and queries


[[mce-autocompleter-close-and-mce-autocompleter-reload]]
==== `mceAutocompleterClose` and `mceAutocompleterReload`

As part of moving `autocompleter` from the default `silver` theme to the {productname} core, two new commands are now available: `mceAutocompleterClose` and `mceAutocompleterReload`.

[[mce-insert-table-dialog]]
==== mceInsertTableDialog

`mceInsertTableDialog` is the new command for invoking an _Insert Table_ dialog box.

The previous command, `mceInsertTable`, no longer works to invoke an _Insert Table_ dialog box: use the `mceInsertTableDialog` command instead.

The `mceInsertTable` command is still the command for inserting a table with specified properties directly and without asking for user input.


[[changed-commands-and-queries]]
=== Changed commands and queries


[[editor]]
==== Editor commands

The Editor commands APIs no longer fallback to executing the browsers native command functionality.

As well, the Editor query command APIs now return `false` or an empty string on removed {productname} editors.


[[element-format]]
==== `element_format`

Previously, `element_format` had no explicit default value. Itâ€™s implicit value, however, was `xhtml`.

In {productname} 6.0, `element_format` now has an explicit default value: `html`.


[[mce-add-editor-and-mce-toggle-editor]]
==== `mceAddEditor` and `mceToggleEditor`

Previously, `mceAddEditor` and `mceToggleEditor` used the `editorManager.settings` values to set the `id` and UI and UX options for a new {productname} editor instance.

`editorManager.settings` is not used at all in {productname} 6.

Instead, the `mceAddEditor` and `mceToggleEditor` commands use `id` and `options` values from an object passed when the command is run.


[[removed-or-deprecated-commands-and-queries]]
=== Removed or deprecated commands and queries


[[exec-command]]
==== `execCommand`

The `execCommand` handler function has been removed from the `plugin` and `theme` interfaces.


[[mce-insert-raw-html]]
==== `mceInsertRawHTML`

The `mceInsertRawHTML` command has been removed.

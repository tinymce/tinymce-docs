This section documents the single known issue that {productname} 6.0 users may encounter and possible workarounds for this issue.

// tag::known-issues[]
There are two known issues affecting {productname} 6.0.

== Unexpected `nonbreaking_force_tab: true` behavior

In {productname} 6.0, if `nonbreaking_force_tab` is set to `true`, pressing the _tab_ key when the insertion point is in a table cell produces an unexpected result.

The expected result is for the insertion point to move to the next available cell in the table.

In {productname} 6.0, three non-breaking-space entities (`+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+`) are entered into the current cell.

The proximate cause of this incorrect behavior is the move of _Tables_ from plugins to core.

As of this release, however, the specific cause is still being investigated.

Workaround::
Other than keeping `nonbreaking_force_tab` set to `false`, no workaround is currently available.

== Editor content can overlap with an open floating toolbar drawer when using certain premium skins

In {productname} 6.0, content within the {productname} editor may visually overlap with the toolbar drawer if

* the floating toolbar drawer is open; and
* one of the following premium skins is being used:
** `snow`
** `naked`
** `outside`
** `fabric`

The expected behavior is for there to be no overlap between the editor content and the toolbar drawer.

Workaround::
Use a toolbar mode other than the default floating mode. For details, see the xref:toolbar-configuration-options.adoc#toolbar_mode[`+toolbar_mode+` option].
+
Otherwise, use a different premium skin than noted above. For details, see: xref:enhanced-skins-and-icon-packs.adoc[Tiny Skins and Icon Packs].

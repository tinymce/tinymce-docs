This section documents the single known issue that {productname} 6.0 users may encounter and possible workarounds for this issue.

// tag::known-issues[]
There are two known issues affecting {productname} 6.0.

== Unexpected `nonbreaking_force_tab: true` behavior

In {productname} 6.0, if `nonbreaking_force_tab` is set to `true`, pressing the _tab_ key when the insertion point is in a table cell produces an unexpected result.

The expected result is for the insertion point to move to the next available cell in the table.

In {productname} 6.0, three non-breaking-space entities (`+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+`) are entered into the current cell.

The proximate cause of this incorrect behavior is the move of _Tables_ from plugins to core.

As of this release, however, the specific cause is still being investigated.

Workaround::
Other than keeping `nonbreaking_force_tab` set to `false`, no workaround is currently available.

== Editor content can overlap with an open floating toolbar drawer when using certain premium skins

In {productname} 6.0, if one of the premium skins, `snow`, `naked`, `outside`, or `fabric` is used and the floating toolbar drawer is open, content within the editor may visually overlap the toolbar drawer.

The expected behavior is for there to be no overlap between the editor content and the toolbar drawer.

Workaround::
There was no known workaround at the time of the release.

This section documents the single known issue that {productname} 6.0 users may encounter and possible workarounds for this issue.

// tag::known-issues[]
There is one known issue affecting {productname} 6.0.

== If `nonbreaking_force_tab: true` pressing the tab key in a table cell produces an unexpected result

In {productname} 6.0, if `nonbreaking_force_tab` is set to `true`, pressing the _tab_ key when the insertion point is in a table cell produces an unexpected result.

The expected result is for the insertion point to move to the next available cell in the table.

In {productname} 6.0, three non-breaking-space entities (`+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+`) are entered into the current cell.

The proximate cause of this incorrect behavior is the move of _Tables_ from plugins to core.

As of this release, however, the specific cause is still being investigated.

Workaround::
Other than keeping `nonbreaking_force_tab` set to `false`, no workaround is currently available.

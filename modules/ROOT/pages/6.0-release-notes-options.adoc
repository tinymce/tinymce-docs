== Options


[[changed-options]]
=== Changed options


[[image-upload-handler]]
==== `image_upload_handler`

Previously the `images_upload_handler` option passed `success` or `failure` callbacks to report the status of an image upload.

In {productname} 6, `images_upload_handler` reports upload results by returning a `Promise`, with a value of either `resolve` or `reject`.


[[link-default-protocol]]
==== link_default_protocol

The `link_default_protocol` option sets the link protocol used by links added or edited using the _link_ dialog.

It now defaults to `https`. Previously it defaulted to `http`.

NOTE: the `link_default_protocol` value is only applied to an edited or inserted link if the protocol is not explicitly specified.

[[tinymce-active-editor-options-get]]
==== tinymce.activeEditor.options.get

Previously `tinymce.activeEditor.options.get('plugins')` returned the configured plugins as a string.

As of {productname} 6, `tinymce.activeEditor.options.get('plugins')` now returns the configured plugins as an array.

[[textpattern]]
==== TextPattern

* the `textpattern_patterns` option is no longer an option. It is has been re-named, to `text_patterns` and is now a Core part of {productname} 6.0.

   All references to `textpattern_patterns` (and `text_patterns`) should be removed from your configurations.

*  Also, the API called `textpattern` has been removed.

*  Finally, text patterns are now on by default. `text_patterns: false` turns the functionality off.

== Plugins

[[plugin-loading-format-change]]
=== Plugin loading format change

{productname} 6.0 allows plugin loading in any of three formats:

. An array of strings:
+
`plugins: [ 'advlist', 'list', 'image', 'help', 'wordcount' ]`
+
. A space-separated string:
+
`plugins: 'advlist list image help wordcount'`
+
. A comma-separated string:
+
`plugins: 'advlist,list,image,help,wordcount'`

Previously, two other formats were allowed: comma-separated strings with spaces and arrays of space-separated strings.

Neither of these formats are allowed in {productname} 6.0.


[[new-and-improved-plugins]]
=== New and improved plugins

[[imagetools]]
==== EditImage

_EditImage_, a https://tiny.cloud/tinymce/features/#productivity[Premium plugin], replaces the now-deprecated and removed _ImageTools_ plugin. The `imagetools` plugin is no longer part of the Core open source editor.

An `editimage` option was also renamed: `editimage_proxy` is now `editimage_proxy_service_url`, making it easier to configure when accessing https://tiny.cloud/docs/enterprise/server/[Tiny-specific services].

`editimage` also offers a new export plugin option: `export_image_proxy_service_url`.

NOTE: `editimage_proxy` (the renamed equivalent to the previous `imagetools_proxy`) is still available as an alternative configuration option for setting up image proxy functionality without using Tiny services.


[[emoticons]]
==== Emoticons

The `emoticon` plugin now uses the more accurate word, _Emoji_, in its tool bar, menu item and dialog box.

In previous versions, the word presented in these parts of the plugin’s user-interface was _Emoticon_.

NOTE: The plugin, itself, is still called Emoticons. And the plugin description and the plugin’s configuration and Help dialogs still reflect this.


[[table-of-contents]]
==== Table of contents

There are no end-user facing changes between the previous `toc` plugin and the `tableofcontents` plugin. However, the `tableofcontents` plugin now uses https://terser.org[terser] to improve performance.

NOTE: the `tableofcontents` plugin is no longer part of the Core open source editor. Table of Contents is now a https://tiny.cloud/tinymce/features/#productivity[Premium plugin].

[[]]
==== Hindi, Malay, and Vietnamese translations added to four Premium Plugins

The following four Premium Plugins now present in Hindi, Malay, and Vietnamese:

* Accessibility Checker
* AdvTable
* Comments
* Spellchecker


[[changed-plugins]]
=== Changed plugins

[[autoresize]]
==== Autoresize

Previously, the `autoresize` plugin offered an `autoresize_on_init` option.

This setting does not do anything meaningful, and had been previously deprecated.

As of {productname} 6.0, `autoresize_on_init` has been removed from the `autoresize` plugin.

[[media]]
==== Media

In {productname} 5.x, the `media` plugin used https://tiny.cloud/docs/api/tinymce.html/tinymce.html.saxparser/[SaxParser] to validate elements for parsing.

As of {productname} 6.0, SaxParser is no longer used. Another {productname} public API — DomParser — is used instead.

As a consequence the `iframe`, `video`, `audio`, and `object` elements are no longer marked as _special_. Instead their contents are simply validated against the {productname} schema.

NOTE: The {productname} public API, DomParser uses, in turn, the same-named browser parsing API: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMParser[DomParser].

Also, the `media` plugin’s `media_scripts` option was deprecated in {productname} 5.10.

// Based on the code it looks like `media_scripts` was meant to be a way to provide an allowed list of <script>s that could be used to embed media. However, somewhere along the lines it broke and no longer works.

As of the release of {productname} 6.0, this option has been removed completely.

[[noneditable]]
==== Noneditable

The `noneditable` plugin is no longer a plugin. It is now a Core part of {productname} 6.0.

In {productname} 6.0, there is no setting or specifying this functionality in the `plugins` option.

All references to `noneditable` should be removed from your plugin configuration. Leaving references to removed plugins in a plugin configuration will cause console errors documenting the plugin failing to load.

[[paste]]
==== Paste

The `paste` plugin’s functionality is now a Core part of {productname} 6.0.

In {productname} 6.0, there is no setting or specifying this functionality in the `plugins` option.

All references to `paste` should be removed from your plugin configuration. Leaving references to removed plugins in a plugin configuration will cause console errors documenting the plugin failing to load.

The `paste_data_images` option now defaults to `true`. When `paste` was a plugin, this option was, by default, set to `false`, which prevented images being pasted from the local machine.

The `mceInsertClipboardContent` argument, `content`, has been renamed. It is now `html`.

The new name is a more accurate reflection of what sort of data the argument passes.

NOTE: `PastePreProcess` also takes an argument, `content`. This argument, for this command, has not changed.


[[print]]
==== Print

`print` functionality is no longer a plugin. It is now a Core part of {productname} 6.0.

In {productname} 6.0, there is no setting or specifying this functionality in the `plugins` option.

All references to `print` should be removed from your plugin configuration. Leaving references to removed plugins in a plugin configuration will cause console errors documenting the plugin failing to load.

[[table]]
==== Table

The `table` plugin’s functionality is, as of {productname} 6.0, entirely focussed on the user interface (UI) for creating and editing tables.

The code that generates tables is now a Core part of {productname} 6.0.

This, now core feature of {productname} 6.0, also includes the following fixes, changes, and improvements.

* If the selected cells in the `tfoot` section of a table were header elements (ie were `th` elements), pressing the `table` row header toolbar button (which invokes the `mceTableRowType` command) returned the row as a header row.

This was incorrect: the section takes precedence and cells in the `tfoot` section of a table should be declared as a footer row.

In {productname} 6.0, selecting cells in the `tfoot` section of a table and pressing the row header toolbar button returns the row as a footer row, as expected.

* `mceInsertTableDialog` is the new command for invoking an _Insert Table_ dialog box.
+
The previous command, `mceInsertTable`, no longer works to invoke an _Insert Table_ dialog box: use the `mceInsertTableDialog` command instead.
+
The `mceInsertTable` command is still the command for inserting a table with specified properties directly and without asking for user-input.
+
* The default values for the `table_style_by_css` and the `table_use_colgroups` options have both been changed.
+
Previously, these options defaulted to `false`. As of {productname} 6.0, both options now default to `true`.
+
This is in line with modern web practice.
+
* the `table_responsive_width` option was previously deprecated and superseded by `table_sizing_mode`.
+
In {productname} 6.0, the `table_responsive_width` option has been removed.

[[changed-plugins-paste]]
==== Paste

The `paste` functionality is no longer a plugin. It is now a Core part of {productname} 6.0.

Because the functionality was unmaintainable, `paste` no longer supports input from Microsoft Word.

There is an open https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/discussions/7487[request for maintainers] should someone in the community be interested in taking over maintainance of this particular functionality as a separate plugin.

If a community-maintained version of the `paste` plugin becomes available, we will link to it from the xref:migration-from-5x.adoc#plugins-paste[_Migration Guide_].

NOTE: the Premium plugin, https://tiny.cloud/docs/plugins/premium/powerpaste/[`PowerPaste`], is available. It provides the capability to accept data from Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel, and clean-up the received data before pasting it into place.

As well, the `tab_focus` option was previously deprecated by `tabfocus_elements`. With this release, the `tab_focus` option has been removed completely.

As per standard web practice, the `tabindex` attribute should be used instead of the `tabfocus` plugin or any of the `tabfocus` plugin’s options.

As per that standard web practice, the `tabindex` attribute is copied from the target element to the iframe.

[[changed-plugins-table-of-contents]]
==== Table of contents

The `toc` plugin is no longer part of the Core open source editor. _Table of Contents_ is now a https://tiny.cloud/tinymce/features/#productivity[Premium plugin].

NOTE: although there are no end-user facing changes, as part of the general architectural change, the `tableofcontents` Premium plugin has modernised its output. It uses the ES2020 library and targets ES2018. It also uses https://terser.org[terser] to improve performance.

== Accompanying Premium Plugin changes

The following premium plugin updates were released alongside {productname} 6.0.

=== Enhanced Image Editing (was ImageTools)

As noted in the xref:6.0-release-notes.adoc#removed-or-deprecated-plugins-imagetools[_{productname} 6.0 Release Notes_], the `imagetools` plugin is no longer included as part of the Free editor.

_ImageTools_ is now _Enhanced Image Editing_, a https://tiny.cloud/tinymce/features/#productivity[Premium plugin].

NOTE: Enhanced Image Editing is the plugin’s name; `editimage` is the string used to reference theh plugin programmatically.

Along with these changes, the `editimage_proxy` option was been renamed to `export_image_proxy_service_url`. The option was renamed to make it easier to configure when using https://tiny.cloud/docs/enterprise/server/[Tiny services].

Finally, `editimage` also offers a new export plugin option: `export_image_proxy_service_url`.

Users of the Free version of {productname} 5.x who rely on the, now deprecated and removed, `imagetools` plugin, should not upgrade to {productname} 6.0 without a https://tiny.cloud/pricing/[subscription plan] that provides access to Premium plugins such as https://tiny.cloud/tinymce/features/#productivity[_EditImage_].

NOTE: `editimage_proxy` (the renamed equivalent to the previous `imagetools_proxy`) is still available as an alternative configuration option for setting up image proxy functionality without using Tiny services.


=== SpellChecker Pro

The free `spellchecker` plugin was removed as no longer supported:

The https://tiny.cloud/tinymce/features/#productivity[Premium plugin], https://tiny.cloud/docs/plugins/premium/tinymcespellchecker/[Spellchecker Pro], which offers equivalent functionality and more, is available.


=== PowerPaste

As noted in the xref:6.0-release-notes.adoc#removed-or-deprecated-plugins-paste[_{productname} 6.0 Release Notes_], the `paste` plugin’s functionality is no longer provided as a plugin. It is now a core part of {productname} 6.0.

Because the functionality was unmaintainable, however, `paste` no longer supports input from Microsoft Word.

The Premium plugin, https://tiny.cloud/docs/plugins/premium/powerpaste/[`PowerPaste`], is now available. It provides the capability to accept data from Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel, and clean-up the received data before pasting it into place.

In conjunction with this, three changes were made to `paste`:

. A `paste` default has changed. The `paste_data_images` option now defaults to `true`.
+
When `paste` was a plugin, this option was, by default, set to `false`, which prevented images being pasted from the local machine.
+
. The `mceInsertClipboardContent` argument, `content`, has been renamed. It is now `html`.
+
The new name is a more accurate reflection of what sort of data the argument passes.
+
The `content` argument can no longer be used with `mceInsertClipboardContent`. If `content` is used, no data is passed. `mceInsertClipboardContent` only attempts to pass data if the `html` or `text` property is used.
+
. The, now built-in, `paste` functionality no longer supports pasting from Microsoft Word.
+
NOTE: There is an open https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/discussions/7487[request for maintainers] should someone in the community be interested in taking over maintainance of this particular functionality as a separate plugin. +
If a community-maintained version of the `paste` plugin becomes available, we will link to it from the xref:migration-from-5x.adoc#plugins-paste[_Migration Guide_].


=== Table of Contents

As noted in the xref:6.0-release-notes.adoc#new-and-improved-plugins-table-of-contents[_{productname} 6.0 Release Notes_], the `toc` plugin is no longer part of the Free editor.

Table of Contents has been updated and is now a https://tiny.cloud/tinymce/features/#productivity[Premium plugin].

Users of the Free version of {productname} 5.x who rely on the, now deprecated and removed, `toc` plugin, should not upgrade to {productname} 6.0 without a https://tiny.cloud/pricing/[subscription plan] that provides access to Premium plugins such as https://tiny.cloud/tinymce/features/#productivity[_Table of Contents_].

The new Premium `tableofcontents` plugin also changes the names of several commands.

* `toc` is now `tableofcontents`
* `tocupdate` is now `tableofcontentsupdate`
* `toc_class` is now `tableofcontents_class`
* `toc_depth` is now `tableofcontents_depth`
* `toc_header` is now `tableofcontents_header`

Any configurations or logic that use the old command names must be updated to the new names after upgrading to {productname} 6.0 and installing the new `tableofcontents` plugin.

NOTE: Although there are no end-user facing changes, as part of the general architectural change, the `tableofcontents` Premium plugin has modernised its output. It uses the ES2020 library and targets ES2018. It also uses https://terser.org[terser] to improve performance.

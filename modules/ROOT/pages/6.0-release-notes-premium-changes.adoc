== Accompanying Premium Plugin changes

The following premium plugin updates were released alongside {productname} 6.0.

=== Enhanced Image Editing (was ImageTools)

As noted in the xref:6.0-release-notes.adoc#removed-or-deprecated-plugins-imagetools[_{productname} 6.0 Release Notes_], the `imagetools` plugin is no longer included as part of the Free editor.

_ImageTools_ is now _Enhanced Image Editing_, a https://tiny.cloud/tinymce/features/#productivity[Premium plugin].

NOTE: Enhanced Image Editing is the plugin’s name; `editimage` is the string used to reference theh plugin programmatically.

Along with these changes, the `editimage_proxy` option was been renamed to `export_image_proxy_service_url`. The option was renamed to make it easier to configure when using https://tiny.cloud/docs/enterprise/server/[Tiny services].

Finally, `editimage` also offers a new export plugin option: `export_image_proxy_service_url`.

Users of the Free version of {productname} 5.x who rely on the, now deprecated and removed, `imagetools` plugin, should not upgrade to {productname} 6.0 without a https://tiny.cloud/pricing/[subscription plan] that provides access to Premium plugins such as https://tiny.cloud/tinymce/features/#productivity[_EditImage_].

NOTE: `editimage_proxy` (the renamed equivalent to the previous `imagetools_proxy`) is still available as an alternative configuration option for setting up image proxy functionality without using Tiny services.


=== SpellChecker Pro

The free `spellchecker` plugin was removed as no longer supported:

The https://tiny.cloud/tinymce/features/#productivity[Premium plugin], https://tiny.cloud/docs/plugins/premium/tinymcespellchecker/[Spellchecker Pro], which offers equivalent functionality and more, is available.


=== PowerPaste

As noted in the xref:6.0-release-notes.adoc#removed-or-deprecated-plugins-paste[_{productname} 6.0 Release Notes_], the `paste` plugin’s functionality is no longer provided as a plugin. It is now a core part of {productname} 6.0.

Because the functionality was unmaintainable, however, `paste` no longer supports input from Microsoft Word.

The Premium plugin, https://tiny.cloud/docs/plugins/premium/powerpaste/[`PowerPaste`] provides the capability to accept data from Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel, and clean-up the received data before pasting it into place.

For this release, the following fixes and changes were also incorporated into PowerPaste.

Previously, when dragging content from outside the editor to inside the editor the pointer did not move with the dragged content as expected.

With this update, dragging content behaves correctly: the {productname} editor takes focus when the drag enters a the pointer follows the dragged content.

As well, content dragged and dropped into the {productname} editor is now cleaned or merged using the same logic as when content is pasted in.

Finally, pasting content from Microsoft Word that included a style block ≥ 1.4 Mb previously triggered a stack overflow.

With this release, such content can be pasted in to a {productname} editor with PowerPaste enabled without issue.

In conjunction with these PowerPaste changes, three changes were made to `paste`:

. A `paste` default has changed. The `paste_data_images` option now defaults to `true`.
+
When `paste` was a plugin, this option was, by default, set to `false`, which prevented images being pasted from the local machine.
+
. The `mceInsertClipboardContent` argument, `content`, has been renamed. It is now `html`.
+
The new name is a more accurate reflection of what sort of data the argument passes.
+
The `content` argument can no longer be used with `mceInsertClipboardContent`. If `content` is used, no data is passed. `mceInsertClipboardContent` only attempts to pass data if the `html` or `text` property is used.
+
. The, now built-in, `paste` functionality no longer supports pasting from Microsoft Word.
+
NOTE: There is an open https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/discussions/7487[request for maintainers] should someone in the community be interested in taking over maintainance of this particular functionality as a separate plugin. +
If a community-maintained version of the `paste` plugin becomes available, we will link to it from the xref:migration-from-5x.adoc#plugins-paste[_Migration Guide_].


=== Table of Contents

As noted in the xref:6.0-release-notes.adoc#new-and-improved-plugins-table-of-contents[_{productname} 6.0 Release Notes_], the `toc` plugin is no longer part of the Core editor.

Table of Contents has been updated and is now a https://tiny.cloud/tinymce/features/#productivity[Premium plugin].

Users of the Free version of {productname} 5.x who rely on the, now deprecated and removed, `toc` plugin, should not upgrade to {productname} 6.0 without a https://tiny.cloud/pricing/[subscription plan] that provides access to Premium plugins such as https://tiny.cloud/tinymce/features/#productivity[_Table of Contents_].

The new Premium `tableofcontents` plugin also changes the names of several commands.

* `toc` is now `tableofcontents`
* `tocupdate` is now `tableofcontentsupdate`
* `toc_class` is now `tableofcontents_class`
* `toc_depth` is now `tableofcontents_depth`
* `toc_header` is now `tableofcontents_header`

Any configurations or logic that use the old command names must be updated to the new names after upgrading to {productname} 6.0 and installing the new `tableofcontents` plugin.

NOTE: Although there are no end-user facing changes, as part of the general architectural change, the `tableofcontents` Premium plugin has modernised its output. It uses the ES2020 library and targets ES2018. It also uses https://terser.org[terser] to improve performance.


=== Tiny Drive

The following improvements, changes, and fixes were made to Tiny Drive.

Tiny Drive supports several new file formats:

* https://developers.google.com/speed/webp[WebP] images (`.webp`).
* https://aomediacodec.github.io/av1-avif/[AV1 Image File Format] (AVIF) files (`.avif`).
* https://wiki.mozilla.org/APNG_Specification[Animated Portable Network Graphic] files (`.apng`).
* further JPEG extensions.

When the *Starred* filter is used, _move_ and _copy_ are now removed from the actions menu.

They are not needed and removing them from the menu obviates a file-moving error.

The third-party PDF renderer used by Tiny Drive, https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/[PDFjs] has been updated to the most recent version.

When Tiny Drive cannot preview a file, it displays a generic file-type icon.

With this release, a text message — _No preview available_ — is also displayed.

Previously, everytime Tiny Drive was opened, the CSS used to present the Tiny Drive instance was re-loaded.

With this release, a check has been added. Tiny Drive’s CSS is now loaded once, when it is first opened, and uses the already loaded CSS on subsequent openings.

Icons presented in the _Upload file_ and _Upload/Create_ menus were inconsistent: some presenting as black and some presenting as white.

This has been corrected: these icons now all present as black or white


//Fixed an issue where a menu would not close in some situations #TD-311

//Unstarring a file while viewing its preview and filtering on only starred files will now update as expected #TD-297

//Renaming a file while in preview dialog will now update the name as expected #TD-297

[[new-premium-plugins]]
== New Premium plugins

=== Footnotes 1.0.0

The {productname} 6.2 release includes the new **Footnotes** premium plugin.

The Footnotes plugin allows the user to add footnotes to {productname} documents.

For information on the **Footnotes** plugin, see: xref:footnotes.adoc[Footnotes].

=== Merge Tags 1.0.0

The {productname} 6.2 release includes the new **Merge Tags** premium plugin.

The Merge Tags plugin allows the user to insert merge tags (also known as personalization tokens, or as mail merge fields) into {productname} documents.

For information on the **Merge Tags** plugin, see: xref:mergetags.adoc[Merge Tags].

=== Spelling Autocorrect 1.0.0

The {productname} 6.2 release includes the new **Autocorrect** premium plugin.

The Spelling Autocorrect plugin allows {productname} to autocorrect a specified set of spelling errors, common typos, and capitalization errors, as they are being typed.

For information on the **Spelling Autocorrect** plugin, see: xref:autocorrect.adoc[Spelling Autocorrect].


[[accompanying-premium-plugin-changes]]
== Accompanying Premium Plugin changes

The following premium plugin updates were released alongside {productname} 6.2.

=== Enhanced Media Embed 3.0.4

The {productname} 6.2 release includes an accompanying release of the **Enhanced Media Embed** premium plugin.

**Enhanced Media Embed** 3.0.4 fixes the following bug:

Previously, embedded audio objects became invisible when a left or right alignment was applied.

With this update all audio objects are set to `min-width: 100px` and now continue to show in {productname} documents when aligned left or right.

For information on the **Enhanced Media Embed** plugin, see: xref:introduction-to-mediaembed.adoc[Enhanced Media Embed].

=== Permanent Pen 2.0.2

The {productname} 6.2 release includes an accompanying release of the **Permanent Pen** premium plugin.

Permanent Pen 2.0.2 fixes the following bug:

Previously, if Permanent Pen was switched off (by, for example, clicking the Permanent Pen button in the toolbar so the button toggles from highlighted to not-highlighed) and the next user-action was to press the *Enter* or *Return* key, Permanent Pen did not turn off as expected.

This update improves Permanent Pen’s activate and deactivate mechanism. When the plugin is switched off and the next user-action is to press either *Enter* or *Return*, Permanent Pen stays switched off.

For information on the **Permanent Pen** plugin, see: xref:permanentpen.adoc[Permanent Pen].

=== PowerPaste 6.1.1

The {productname} 6.2 release includes an accompanying release of the **PowerPaste** premium plugin.

PowerPaste 6.1.1 fixes the following bug:

The `wordimport.js` resource file was difficult to bundle when using Webpack 5.

With this update, bundling is not as difficult.

For information on the **PowerPaste** plugin, see: xref:introduction-to-powerpaste.adoc[PowerPaste].

=== Real-Time Collaboration 2.1.1

The {productname} 6.2 release includes an accompanying release of the **Real-Time Collaboration** premium plugin.

Real-Time Collaboration 2.1.1 fixes the following bug:

The Real-Time Collaboration plugin checks that parameters used to set the token provider, among other settings, are valid link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise[Promises].

However, Angular code wraps promises into ZoneAwarePromises. These fail said validation, throwing an `expected it to return a promise` error.

With this update, providers now accept any object that has `then` and `catch` functions as compatible with promise-like objects.

For information on the **Real-Time Collaboration** plugin, see: xref:rtc-introduction.adoc[Real-Time Collaboration].

=== Spell Checker Pro 3.1.0

The {productname} 6.2 release includes an accompanying release of the **Spell Checker Pro** premium plugin.

Spell Checker Pro 3.1.0 adds one change and fixes two bugs:

==== The `SpellcheckerLanguageChanged` event is now dispatched at plugin initialization

Spell Checker Pro now fires the `SpellcheckerLanguageChanged` event when it is initialized, making the language Spell Checker Pro has been configured to use available for querying.

This enables other plugins to check for the currently configured language.

==== In some specific cases, copying and pasting in tables did not work as expected due to Spell Checker Pro incorrectly moving the selection

In some circumstances, Spell Checker Pro would silently, and incorrectly, extend a selection. When the extended selection was then copied-and-pasted, unexpected results occurred.

For example, in some circumstances the selection appeared to be the contents of a single table cell, but Spell Checker Pro incorrectly extended the selection to include an HTML markup element outside the table. When this was pasted, the incorrectly added element made the paste behave incorrectly.

With this update, the way elements are traversed when selections are being made has been changed. Consequently, incorrect selection extension no longer occurs, and copying-and-pasting content from tables works as expected.

==== Spellchecking incorrectly triggered on all `change` events

Spell Checker Pro should trigger on any `paste` event, whether the event comes from a plugin (such as Paste or PowerPaste) or a native browser action. Previously, however, Spell Checker Pro was listening to the wrong event — the `change` event — to cover this case.

As a consequence, Spell Checker Pro triggered on all `change` events.

With this update, Spell Checker Pro now listens for input events and only triggers when content is inserted into a {productname} document.

For information on the **Spell Checker Pro** plugin, see: xref:introduction-to-tiny-spellchecker.adoc[Spell Checker Pro].

[[accompanying-premium-skins-and-icon-packs-changes]]
== Accompanying Premium Skins and Icon Packs changes

The {productname} 6.2 release includes an accompanying release of the **Premium Skins and Icon Packs**.

=== Premium Skins and Icon Packs

The **Premium Skins and Icon Packs** release includes the following updates:

Two new icons were added to all icon packs: `addtag` and `footnote`.

The **Premium Skins and Icon Packs** were rebuilt to pull in the changes also incorporated into the default {productname} 6.2 skin, Oxide.

For information on using premium skins and icon packs, see: xref:premium-skins-and-icons.adoc[Premium Skins and Icon Packs].


[[improvements]]
== Improvements

{productname} 6.2 also includes the following improvements:

=== Formatting can now be applied to an element that has a `contenteditable="false"` attribute

Elements with `contenteditable="false"` attributes can now have formatting applied to them that wraps the element.

For example, such elements can now be set to *bold* or _italic_. As well, such elements can have their font and font-size changed.

This new capability is configurable using the new `format_noneditable_selector` option.

For details see xref:content-formatting.adoc#format_noneditable_selector[Content Formatting].

=== The autocompleter now supports a multiple character trigger using the new trigger configuration

Previously, the autocompleter only supported a single character trigger.

With this update, the autocompleter now supports multi-character triggers.

The new xref:mergetags.adoc[Merge Tags] Premium plugin, for example, uses the string `+{{+` as its default trigger.

=== Some inline formatting, such as color and font size, can now be applied to list item elements

In {productname} 6.2 list bullets and list numbers can be inline formatted.

If the contents of a list item are selected and inline formatting is applied — such as a change of color or change of font-size — this spot-formatting is also applied to the list item’s associated bullet or number.

For more information see the xref:advlist.adoc#inline-formatting[Inline formatting of list elements documentation].

=== Alignment can now be applied to more embedded media element types

Embedded media elements could not, previously, be set to left, right, or center alignment.

With this update they can. Selecting an embedded media element and clicking the left, right, or center alignment toolbar buttons, or selecting the appropriate option from the *Format > Align* sub-menu, sets the element to the chosen alignment.


[[additions]]
== Additions

{productname} 6.2 also includes the following additions:

=== A new `text_patterns_lookup` option to provide additional text patterns dynamically

{productname} 6.2 includes a new `text_patterns_lookup` option.

This option allows the specification of a function that dynamically appends additional text patterns to the default xref:content-behavior-options.adoc#text_patterns[text_patterns].

The function takes a context object as an argument and returns an array of text patterns. This function is called whenever the editor triggers text pattern matching.

For details see xref:content-behavior-options.adoc#text_patterns_lookup[Content Behavior Options].

=== A new promotion element has been added to the default UI

{productname} 6.2 includes an *Upgrade* promotion button. It appears in the unused corner of the {productname} menu bar.

It can be disabled using the new `promotion` option.

For more information see xref:content-appearance.adoc#premium-upgrade-promotion-option[Premium upgrade promotion option].

=== New `format_noneditable_selector` option to specify the `contenteditable="false"` elements that can be wrapped in a format

Elements with `contenteditable="false"` attributes can now have formatting applied to them.

And this new capability is configurable using the new `format_noneditable_selector` option.

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  format_noneditable_selector: 'span,p.special'
});
----

For details see xref:content-formatting.adoc#format_noneditable_selector[Content Formatting].

=== Added `allow` as a valid attribute for the `iframe` element in the editor schema

Previously, the `allow` attribute was not considered a valid attribute for `iframe` elements in the {productname} schema. It now is.

When a {productname} editor with an `allow` attribute —

[source,html]
----
<iframe allow="fullscreen" style="width: 200px; height: 200px; border: 1px solid blue"></iframe>
----

— is initialized, the `allow` attribute will still be present in the rendered `iframe` element.

=== Menu toolbar buttons can now contain a search field

Menu toolbar buttons, buttons on the {productname} toolbar that show a menu when clicked, can now present a search field at the top of the menu.

The button refetches items as the search field is updated.

The new xref:mergetags.adoc[Merge Tags] Premium plugin includes a menu toolbar button with this new search field.


[[changes]]
== Changes

{productname} 6.2 also incorporates the following changes:

=== The `@menubar-row-separator-color` oxide variable no longer affects the divider between the menu bar and Toolbar

Testing revealed circumstances in which an unnecessary border was added under the {productname} menu bar.

This update includes changes to the `@menubar-row-separator-color` oxide variable. It now only controls the color of the separator lines drawn in multiline Menu bars.

Consequently, unnecessary borders are no longer added under the {productname} menu bar.

=== The `@toolbar-separator-color` oxide variable now affects the color of the separator between the menu bar and Toolbar only

In concert with the testing above that discovered an unnecessary border occasionally being added under the {productname} menu bar, the `@toolbar-separator-color` oxide variable was also changed.

This variable now only affects the color of the separator between the {productname} menu bar and the {productname} Toolbar.

=== Available Premium plugins, which are listed by name in the Help dialog, are no longer translated

Previously, when the *Help > Help* dialog was invoked, and the _Plugins_ list was selected, available Premium plugins were supposed to be presented in alphabetical order by name.

This was done manually, however, and the manual presentation was not entirely alphabetical.

Also, this manual sort did not take account of the selected UI language and the Premium plugin names were not, in the main, translated.

With this update Premium plugin names are explicitly not translated. But they are, now, correctly sorted in alphabetical order by name.

[[bug-fixes]]
== Bug fixes

=== The Autolink plugin did not work when text nodes in the content were fragmented

The most common cause of text fragmentation is the Spell Checker Pro plugin, which fragments text nodes as part of its normal workings.

Previously, however, when text nodes were fragmented, the Autolink plugin’s URL text detection did not work.

This presented as, for example, FQDN strings such as `www.example.com` not being converted into a link.

In {productname} 6.2, the Autolink plugin is now able to handle this text node fragmentation and correctly converts URL-like strings such as FQDNs into a clickable link.

=== Fixed multiple incorrect types on public APIs found while enabling TypeScript strict mode

As part of switching to TypeScript’s strict mode, multiple public {productname} APIs were found to be typed incorrectly.

These types have been corrected types in {productname} 6.2. 

=== The number of blank lines returned from `editor.getContent({format: 'text'})` differed between browsers

In some browsers, blank lines in a {productname} document were being returned as plain text by `editor.getContent({format: 'text'})` with a different number of newlines — `+\n+` — than expected.

For example, if the underlying HTML was

[source,html]
----
<p>line-1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>line-2</p>
----

`editor.getContent({format: 'text'})` could, depending on the host browser, return

[listing]
----
line-1\n\n\n\n\nline-2
----

This is one more newline character than expected.

There were two related causes for this behavior: an attribute not being assigned to a `<br>` tag when required, and {productname} not removing unnecessary elements when parsing the content.

For this update, both these causes have been corrected, and the number of newlines returned as plain text by `editor.getContent({format: 'text'})` is the number expected.

=== The editor focused via the `auto_focus` option was not scrolled into the viewport

Previously, when a {productname} editor was not in view and was set to auto focus, the editor was focused but did not scroll into view in some browsers.

With this update, when auto focus is set, the editor is focused and scrolled into view even when the editor is outside the viewport, no matter the host browser.

=== Adding spaces immediately after a `<span>` containing a `contenteditable="false"` attribute did not work properly in some circumstances

Previously, pressing the *Space bar* when the insertion point was immediately after a `span` containing a `contenteditable="false"` attribute did not consistently insert a space.

This was known to occur on Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome and was consequent to issues related to insertion point movement and non-breaking spaces.

{productname} 6.2 deals with these issues and typing a space immediately after a block with a `contenteditable="false"` attribute now adds that space, as expected.

=== Elements with only `data-*` custom attributes were sometimes removed when they should not be removed

Previously, when removing formatting from content that had elements with only custom data attributes, those elements could be incorrectly removed as part of the remove formatting operation.

For this update the remove formatting logic was changed. In {productname} 6.2 all non-{productname} specific or non-{productname} internal `data-*` custom attributes are considered content that must be preserved.

=== Selecting a figure with `class="image"` incorrectly highlighted the link toolbar button

Previously, when inserting an image with a caption, the `image` plugin created a `figure` element. However, the `link` plugin treated the `figure` element as a link, even when the image caption did not contain a link.

This caused the link toolbar button to, incorrectly, highlight.

As of this update, the `link` plugin does not treat images with captions as links when the image caption does not contain a link. And the link toolbar no longer highlights incorrectly.


=== Specifying a single, non-default list style for the `advlist_bullet_styles` and `advlist_number_styles` options was not respected

Previously, when a single, non-default, list style for the `advlist_bullet_styles` and `advlist_number_styles` options was set, pressing the `bullist` and `numlist` toolbar buttons still applied a default list style.

This has been corrected and, with this update, {productname} behaves as expected.

Pressing a list toolbar button when a single, non-default list style is set now applies the list style correctly.


=== Fixed multiple issues that occurred when formatting elements with `contenteditable` attributes

For this update, the formatting logic has been refactored to improve the handling of elements containing `+contenteditable=”false”+` and `+contenteditable=”true”+` attributes.

In particular, this includes ensuring that formatting is not directly removed from elements with `+contenteditable=”false”+` attributes when merging duplicate or similar formatting between parent, sibling and child elements.

=== Spaces could be incorrectly added to `urlinput` dialog components in certain cases

The handling of spaces inserted into the xref:dialog-components.adoc#urlinput[UrlInput] dialog component, specifically its implementation in the xref:link[Link Dialog], was inconsistent.

It allowed spaces to be entered when it was empty and the text input contained text, but did not allow spaces to be entered when both fields were empty.

In {productname} 6.2, the xref:dialog-components.adoc#urlinput[UrlInput] dialog component no longer allows leading or trailing spaces. Only spaces within other text content are now allowed.


=== The text patterns logic threw an error when there were fragmented text nodes in a paragraph

Previously, pressing *Enter* or *Return* to trigger an inline replacement text pattern could, in certain circumstances, throw an error to the console.

[listing]
----
> tinymce.min.js:9 Uncaught DOMException: Failed to execute 'setEnd' on 'Range'
----

For this update the text pattern logic was improved to handle these cases and these console errors are no longer thrown.

=== Dragging a `contentEditable=false` element towards a document’s edge did not cause scrolling

Previously, when an element with a `contenteditable=false` attribute was dragged towards the document’s edge, the drag did not cause scrolling. This meant such elements could only be dropped within the current viewport.

When dragging other elements (such as an image), as the dragged element approaches the edge of the document, {productname} starts scrolling, allowing these other elements to be dropped anywhere in the document.

With this update, dragging an element with a `contenteditable=false` attribute towards the document edge triggers scrolling, allowing for dropping the element anywhere in the document.

In {productname} 6.2, dragging elements with `contentEditable=false` attributes now results in the same behavior as dragging other draggable elements.


=== Parsing large documents no longer throws a Maximum call stack size exceeded exception

Previously, parsing very large documents would throw an error to the console that they had exceeded the Maximum call stack size. 

For example:

[listing]
----
tinymce.min.js:9 Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
    at tinymce.min.js:9:144118
    at zp (tinymce.min.js:9:143461)
    at zp (tinymce.min.js:9:143480)
    at zp (tinymce.min.js:9:143507)
    at zp (tinymce.min.js:9:143507)
----

the {productname} 6.2 parsing logic was updated and {productname} can now handle large documents without throwing this error.

=== DomParser filter matching was not checked between filters, which could lead to an exception in the parser

When inserting content, each node has their attributes run through a number of filters.

By default, only the filters within {productname} are run. Users are, however, able to add their own filters to run before any {productname} filters, using the xref:apis/tinymce.html.domparser.adoc[DomParser API].

Previously, this node filter function did not check whether the next filter was still valid for all nodes. This meant the {productname} filters naively assumed that each attribute would be available for each filter.

This situation, which was not identified by default, could, when using a custom filter, potentially remove a necessary attribute for the next filter. This resulted in a console error.

This has been fixed in {productname} 6.2 by checking that each filter is still valid with the current attributes before running that filter.


=== Fixed `contenteditable="false"` lists and `contenteditable="true"` list elements issues

Previously, lists with `contenteditable="false"` attributes could be toggled and updated. And, within those lists, list elements with `contenteditable="true"` attributes could be indented, split into another list element, or appended to the previous list element by deletion.

Neither behavior was correct and, as of {productname} 6.2, this has been corrected.

In {productname} 6.2, list functionality in this regard is dependent on the state of the closest inheritable `contenteditable` attribute.

If a `list` has a `contenteditable` attribute value of its own, this is, of course the closest ‘inheritable’ attribute, and the list and its child elements take that value.

If a `list` does not have a `contenteditable` attribute value of its own and the immediate parent of the `list` is a `div` which does have a `contenteditable` attribute set, the `list` will inherit the value of this attribute.

However, if the `list` has a `contenteditable` attribute value of its own it will take this value rather than the value of the parent div.

Likeiwse, if a child element of a `list` (for example, an `+<li>+`) has a `contenteditable` attribute value of its own, it will take this value rather than the value of any parent element.


=== Removed extra bottom padding in the context toolbar of the TinyMCE 5 skin

In {productname} 6.0, extra padding was added to the context toolbar and, consequently, separator lines were incorrectly drawn on multi-line toolbars when using either the `tinymce-5` skin or premium skins.

With this update the extra padding was removed and separator lines in {productname} 6.2 multi-line toolbars are drawn correctly.

=== Fixed a regression where pressing Enter added or deleted content outside the selection

A regression found in {productname} 6.0 caused inline elements with `contenteditable="false"` attributes to be incorrectly removed when *Enter* or *Return* were pressed on a selection which began before, and entered into, the block containing the element.

This regression was fixed in {productname} 6.2 and pressing *Enter* or *Return* in this circumstance no longer incorrectly removes these elements.

=== Fixed a regression where pressing Enter deleted selected `contenteditable="false" <pre>` elements

A regression found in {productname} 6.0 caused `preformatted` elements with `contenteditable="false"` attributes to incorrectly insert a newline when *Enter* or *Return* were pressed.

This regression was fixed in {productname} 6.2 and pressing *Enter* or *Return* no longer inserts an erroneous newline.


=== The `editor.insertContent()` API did not respect the `no_events` argument

If, for example, `editor.insertContent('<p>test</p>', { no_events: true });` was run, `BeforeSetContent` and `SetContent` events were still fired, despite `no_events` being set to `true`.

With this update, the API respects the `no_events: true` property. Adding content to a {productname} document with `no_events` set to true now adds the content without firing events, as expected.

[[deprecated]]
== Deprecated

=== The `autocompleter` configuration property, `ch`, has been deprecated

The `ch` autocompleter configuration property will be removed in the next major release.

The `trigger` property should be used instead, as it allows one or more characters to be specified.

[source,js]
----
trigger: '<string>',
----


[[known-issues]]
== Known issues

This section describes issues that users of {productname} 6.2 may encounter and possible workarounds for these issues.

There are three known issues in {productname} 6.2, all affecting the new premium plugin, xref:mergetags.adoc[Merge Tags].

=== Merge Tags cannot be manually added to a {productname} document in some circumstances

There are several circumstances where typing the Merge tags prefix (by default, `+{{+`) does not activate the `autocompleter`. Consequently, choosing a Merge tag from the expected pop-up menu is not possible because the pop-up menu does not present.

Moreover, in the circumstances where the `autocompleter` does not activate, even typing the entire Merge tag does not result in the string being turned in to a Merge tag.

There is a workaround, however.

If typing the Merge tags prefix does not work as expected, clicking the Merge tags toolbar button and selecting the desired Merge tag from the resultant menu inserts a functioning Merge tag.

=== Merge tags does not validate inserted strings that match merge tag syntax

If a string is pasted or otherwise inserted into a {productname} document and that string presents as a complete merge tag, the Merge tag plugin will turn the string into an apparently working merge tag, regardless of the string’s content.

For example, if a {productname} instance is running the Merge tags plugin and the plugin is using the default prefix and suffix characters — `+{{+` and `+}}+` — pasting

`{{not.a.merge.tag.value.for.this.document}}`

into the document results in the pasted string being turned in to an apparently working tag, ready to take whatever values `not.a.merge.tag.value.for.this.document` is the placeholder for.

There is no current workaround.

=== A Merge tags UI element has not been translated

{productname} 6.2 adds a new UI option to menu toolbar buttons. These buttons can now present a search field at the top of the menu.

As text is entered in to this search field, the menu contents update in real-time. And, when nothing in the menu matches the entered string, the MenuButton presents a _No matches_ result.

This particular string, _No matches_ has not been translated.

There is no current workaround. This error is slated for fixing in a future {productname} release.

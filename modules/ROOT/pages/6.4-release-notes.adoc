[[accompanying-premium-plugin-changes]]
== Accompanying Premium Plugin changes

The following premium plugin updates were released alongside {productname} 6.4.

=== Advanced Typography 1.0.1

The {productname} 6.4 release includes an accompanying release of the **Advanced Typography** premium plugin.

**Advanced Typography** 1.0.1 includes the following fixes, additions, and improvements.

=== Fixed adding redundant space between a comma and a quote by switching the sequence of executing safe and unsafe rules

//https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9442
After {productname} introduced the Smart Typography plugin, a bug was discovered that was causing a space to be introduced between a comma and a closing double-quote mark, as shown in the example below:

.Example
> “They went that way,[space introduced here]” he said as he pointed.

As demonstrated in the example above, an unintentional or redundant space was inserted into a separate node position without intention.

{productname} fixed the issue by changing the sequence of executing safe and unsafe rules surrounding Typography.

In {productname} version 6.4, the Smart Typography plugin no longer creates a space between a comma and a closing double-quote mark.

=== Added common/space/delBetweenExclamationMarks to remove spaces between exclamation marks

//https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9398		

An issue was discovered that affected the typography plugin in previous versions of {productname} when inserting content into the editor. Specifically, the issue involved exclamation marks and the spaces between them, such as in the example `“Hello! !“`. This issue prevented the editor from removing the spaces between the double *exclamation marks* `! !` after executing the typography plugin toolbar or menubar button.

The fix for this involved adding a new rule which removes the spaces between exclamation marks when the typography button is pressed.

In {productname} 6.4, spaces are now removed between exclamation marks `!!` for formatted HTML documents when the typography plugin is used. To learn more about Advanced Typography and how to add this new premium plugin to your project, please refer xref:advanced-typography.adoc[Advanced Typography].

=== Added typography plugin to the default menubar

//https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9450		

In previous versions of {productname}, the typography button would *not* appear in the `menubar` by default. As a consequence, the user could only `find` the typography button in the `toolbar` due to it not appearing in the `menubar` dropdown.

To correct this bug, the typography plugin was added to the default `menubar` config.

{productname} 6.4, by default, will now display the typography button in both the `toolbar` and below the “Source code" button in the `menubar`.

=== Typography button and menu item will be disabled if editor has no content

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9441
In previous versions of {productname}, the typography plugin button would render to the toolbar when the editor contained no content.

As a consequence of this, users would be able to apply the typography button features to an editor that contained no physical content.

As a fix, {productname} added some new improvements to the Advanced Typography plugin that now disables the users ability to apply the plugin and use its features, when the editor content value returns as `empty`.

In {productname} 6.4, applying the typography button to an empty editor, will no longer be possible.

=== Merge Tags 1.2.0

The {productname} 6.4 release includes an accompanying release of the **Merge Tags** premium plugin.

**Merge Tags** 1.2.0 includes the following change.

==== The mceMergeTag command now preserves the selected content as a plain text and wraps it in a merge tag prefix and suffix if the content length exceeds the limit.

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9444

In previous versions of {productname}, `mceMergeTag's` would not preserve the selected content within the merge tag `prefix` and `suffix` in some events.

As a consequence, when the user applied the trailing suffix `}}` to the end of the content, the selected content wrapped within the `mceMergeTag` would not be preserved as plain text.  This would occur in specifically in instances when the `mceMergeTag` content length exceeded the character limit set by {productname}.

To fix this issue, improvements to the `mceMergeTag` commands were introduced with the release of {productname} 6.4, that focused on adding a new feature that impacts the way text_patterns handle specific cases such as when `mceMergeTag's` exceed the character limit set by {productname}. These improvements now wrap any content that exceeds the `mceMergeTag` limit, by converting the content into *plain text* whilst encapsulating it in the `prefix` and `suffix`.

As a result of these improvements, the `mceMergeTag` command now preserves the selected content as a plain text and wraps it in a merge tag `prefix` and `suffix` as expected.

[NOTE]
Any content that is covered into plain text that exceeds the `mceMergeTag` character limit rules, will not be converted into an official `mceMergeTag`.

// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480

For information on the **Merge Tags** plugin, see: xref:mergetags.adoc[Merge Tags].


=== PowerPaste 6.1.3

The {productname} 6.4 release includes an accompanying release of the **PowerPaste** premium plugin.

**PowerPaste** 6.1.3 includes the following fixes, additions, and improvements.

=== Comments 3.3.0

The {productname} 6.4 release includes an accompanying release of the **Comments** premium plugin.

**Comments** 3.3.0 includes the following fix.

==== The comment input box now has a max height to prevent long comments from expanding the box indefinitely

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-8894
In previous versions of {productname}, the comment input box for the popup dialog would exceed the max height for the {productname} viewport.

As a consequence, in situations when the user would insert content into the input field, the height of the comment box would expand beyond the max viewport height (vh), for {productname}.  This caused UX issues which restricted the users ability to `submit` the add **Comment** button as it was forced outside of the border `bounds` of the {productname} editor. 

To fix this issue, {productname} introduced two changes which improved the way the **Comment** input box behaves.

. Updates to the max height for the **Comment** input box, which now prevents long comments from expanding the box indefinitely beyond the editor set `bounds`. 
. Set new heights for the **Comment** containers that is focused on improving the visibility of long comments by containing them within a smaller scrolling space with the added benefit of `SHOW MORE` or `SHOW LESS`.

As a result, the input box for the **Comments** premium plugin now offers these improvements with the most recent release of {productname} 6.4.
// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480

=== Enhanced Media Embed 3.0.5

The {productname} 6.4 release includes an accompanying release of the **Enhanced Media Embed** premium plugin.

[[accompanying-premium-skins-and-icon-packs-changes]]
== Accompanying Premium Skins and Icon Packs changes

The {productname} 6.4 release includes an accompanying release of the **Premium Skins and Icon Packs**.

=== Premium Skins and Icon Packs

The **Premium Skins and Icon Packs** release includes the following updates:

The **Premium Skins and Icon Packs** were rebuilt to pull in the changes also incorporated into the default {productname} 6.4 skin, Oxide.

For information on using premium skins and icon packs, see: xref:premium-skins-and-icons.adoc[Premium Skins and Icon Packs].


[[improvement]]
== Improvement

{productname} 6.4 also includes the following improvement:

=== Direct invalid child text nodes of list elements will be wrapped in list item elements.

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-4818

Invalid child nodes were throwing a `Uncaught TypeError:` when `<ol>` tags directly included a text node. This `TypeError` would not allow the user to `Tab` a text node while nested within `<ol>/<li>` HTML tags.

Improvements were made to add a content filter for lists within {productname} 6.4. This improvement meant that any _invalid child nodes_ nested within `<li>` elements would be wrapped with this filter to avoid the `Uncaught TypeError:`.

In {productname} 6.4, direct _invalid child text nodes_ of list elements are now wrapped in list item elements, which allow the user to now `Tab` nested text nodes that are within `<ol>/<li>` tags.
// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480

=== Templates will be parsed before preview and insertion to make preview consistent with inserted template content and prevent XSS

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9244
In previous versions of {productname}, templates were being parsed before `preview` and `insertion` to make preview consistent with content being inserted into the template to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues.
As a consequence, the Templates plugin would not automatically format or sanitise the HTML passed to it as templates. This means that when previewing templates, the content may look different compared to when it is actually inserted into the editor. This can be a security issue, as unsanitised HTML can allow for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), which can be harmful.

To prevent this from happening, {productname} made improvements to the Template plugin that now sanitises content when retrieving preview content, and again before running `editor.dom.create` on it during the template insertion action. By doing this, all preview content will now match the template when it is inserted into the editor, which removed the possibility of any XSS issues arrising.

In {productname} 6.4, Templates are now parsed before preview and insertion to make preview consistent with inserted template content and prevent XSS from occuring.

// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480

=== Pressing backspace in an empty line now preserves formatting in a previous empty line

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9454
In previous versions of {productname}, pressing `backspace` in an empty line would not preserve previously applied formatting to the previous line.

As a consequence, when backspacing from an empty block from another empty block within {productname}, the editor would lose the preserved formatting for the previous block element.
Its worth noting that `_this action is only excpected for when content is inserted into a `br[data-mce-bogus]` empty block. This is because the br[data-mce-bogus] tag is programmed to reset the formatting to the default setting for a empty block such as the `br`.

[TIP]
To avoid this, it is *important* to use a `backspace` instead of an `enter key` when moving from one empty block to another. This will ensure that the formatting of the previous block is preserved and the `br[data-mce-bogus]` tag is not inserted.

To fix this issue, {productname} added improvements that now allow merge blocks to filter all block element decentants, such as the `br[data-mce-bogus]` block element, to ensure preservation of previously applied formatting is not removed from other block elements.

In {productname} 6.4, pressing backspace in an empty line now preserves formatting in a previous empty line.

// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480

=== Pressing enter inside the inputfontsize input would not move the focus back into the editor content

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9598
During development for the new `fontsizeinput` toolbar item, an issue was found that by pressing enter inside the input field would not move the `focus` back into the {productname} editor body. 

As a consequence, any changes made to the font size within the new toolbar input field, would result in the user having no way to use the new font size within the editor.

After some improvements to the `fontsizeinput` toolbar item, pressing enter in the input field now sets the focus back to the {productname} editor viewport, which allows the new font size to be used. 

In {productname} 6.4, pressing enter inside the `inputfontsize` input now returns the focus back to the editor content body.
// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480


[[additions]]
== Additions

{productname} 6.4 also includes the following additions:

=== New tree component that can be used in dialog body panel

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9532
A new tree component has been created to support the *Advanced Template* premium plugin that works in conjuction with a new tree dialog body panel.

This tree component is limited to *one* level and is used in the dialog body panel to allow users to organize templates into levels for better UI. The tree component is designed to create a visual representation of the hierarchical structure for the template system, which allows users to easily identify the various templates and levels within each catagory, giving users the ability to quickly and easily navigate through the templates, and select the right one for their needs.

This new tree component is an important addition to the new Premium Plugin: *Advanced Templates*, which is now available as a premium plugin with editors running {productname} v6.4+.

// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480

=== renderUI property in the Theme type can now return a Promise <RenderResult> instead of RenderResult

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9556
In earlier versions of {productname}, the properties set for the `renderUI`, was causing issues with the theme rendering load times. As a result {productname} 6.4 added fixes to the `renderUI` properties to correct this issue.

The changes saw the introduction of a new `renderUI` property called `Promise<RenderResult>` , which allows the current theme type to return a `Promise<RenderResult>` instead of the origional  `RenderResult`.

In {productname} 6.4, the `renderUI` property in the Theme type, now returns a `Promise <RenderResult>`.
// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480

=== New isEditable API to editor.selection that returns true or false if the current selection is editable

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9462
// bforte this seems to be connected to https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/DOC-1888
In previous versions of {productname}, elements that where within the `editor.selection` could be modified, if they sat within a HTML document body with the properties set to `contentEditable = false`.

As a consequence, any `selection | node`, that was encapsulate within the editor body, could be affected by this such as:

Expected output example:

[source, HTML]
----
<p>Try to insert content here</p>
----

After executing a `onclick` event within the current `selection | node` using `<button onclick="tinymce.activeEditor.insertContent('text')">insertContent</button>`, the output would modify the existing `contentEditable = false;` element, which should not be possible.

[source, HTML]
----
<p>Try to inserttextcontent here</p>
----

The new additions and improvements with the introduction of {productname} 6.4, include a new `isEditable` API been added to the `editor.selection` which now blocks the `editor.insertContent` API and `mceInsertContent` command when the contents return a `true` value if the editor detects the element is a `contentEditable = false;` element in a `contentEditable = false;` root.

As a result, any `editor.selection` elements that return a `true` value when a specified element is `contentEditable = true;`, will call the new `isEditable` API to execute the new blocker.

// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480

=== New isEditable API to editor.dom that returns true or false if the specified node is editable

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9462
In previous versions of {productname}, elements within the editor.dom could be _modified_ regardless if they were assigned to be `contentEditable = true;` or `contentEditable = false;`.

As a consequence all elements within the root `body` set to `contentEditable = false;` value, were affected by the issue.

The new additions and improvements with the introduction of {productname} 6.4, include a new `isEditable` API been added to the `editor.dom` which now blocks the `editor.insertContent` API and `mceInsertContent` command when the contents return a `true` value if the editor detects the element is a `contentEditable = false;` in a `contentEditable = false;` root.

As a result, any elements that return a `true` value when a specified element is `contentEditable = true;`, will call the new `isEditable` API to action the new blocker to ensure `contentEditable = false;` elements cannot be modified when they are within a root that is set to `contentEditable = false`.

// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480

=== New setText and setIcon methods added to menu button and toolbar button apis
// bforte this is related to https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/DOC-1900
// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9268
Previous versions of {productname}, the menu button APIs did not behave as expected with the parent `icon` or `text` selection. As a consequence, the menu button API, would not extend or update the parent `icon` or `text` directly, based upon what `icon` or `text` the user had selected within the menubar.

In {productname} 6.4, two new additions were added to the menu button API.

. Added `setText` and `setIcon` properties to both the toolbar button `api`, and menu button `api`.
. Provided the menu button `api` property as an *argument* which will fetch a function that will allow menu items to change the `icon` or `text` of the parent menu button.

As a result, in {productname} 6.4, menu items can change based on the parent menu button `api` properties.

=== New highlight_on_focus option which enables highlighting the content area on focus
// bforte this is related to https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/DOC-1893
// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9277
In previous versions of {productname}, when using `devtools` such as `Chrome devTools`, the editor content area would not render the `focus` border when the editor was `infocus`.

As a consequence, this issue, whilst creating no impending impacts on the functionality of the editor, would create an inconsistency with the visual UX for the `devTools` environment. As `devTools` is used by developers to inspect the rendered HTML, and troubleshoot issues, the importance for rendering {productname} elements is vital. 

To fix this issue, {productname} 6.4, made some changes to the `focusController` to ensure that when the editor content is `infocus` the editor will render the highlighted border within `devTools`, and when the editor is not `infocus` to remove `focus`.

In {productname} 6.4, the editor now renders the highlighted border when in `focus` which is visible only via `devTools`.

// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480

=== New fontsizeinput toolbar item which allows the user to set the size via input and also increase and decrease it with + and - buttons
// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9429
In previous versions of {productname}, users did not have the ability to set their font size by either direct input into a component field or by using plus `+` or minus `-` buttons.

As a consequence, {productname} introduced a new UI component that gives users an option to set the default unit of measure (UOM) for font sizes via the new input field or the plus `+` or minus `-` buttons within the toolbar when the `fontsizeinput` is set within the tinymce.init() such as the below:

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
    selector: "textarea",  // change this value according to your HTML
    toolbar: "fontsizeinput",
    font_size_input_default_unit: "pt"
});
----

[NOTE]
More details about this component and the possible values that can be used within the new `fontsizeinput` input field can be found in `xref:available-toolbar-buttons.adoc#the-core-toolbar-buttons[fontsizeinput]`.

// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480

=== Added skipFocus option to the ToggleToolbarDrawer command to preserve focus

//https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9337		

A focusing event that was in the initial *FloatingToolbarButton* config, in previous versions of {productname} in (2019) was causing `focus` issues with the *ToggleToolbarDrawer*. As a consequence, this meant that while the editor was been scrolled into `focus`(viewport position), and the *ToggleToolbarDrawer* command `skipFocus: boolean` was set, the toolbar draw could still take `focus` when It was not meant to.

In {productname} 6.4, a improvement was made to the focusing `event` which is now removed after toggling the toolbar.

As a result to the fix, while the *FloatingToolbarButton* `focus` is initiated, the toolbar now focuses correctly without stealing `focus` when `skipFocus: 'boolean' is set.

=== New font_size_input_default_unit option allow to use of numbers without a unit in fontsizeinput and have them parsed with the default unit, if it is not defined the default is pt

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9585
In early development prior to release of the 'new toolbar component' ("fontsizeinput"), users had to define the unit of measurement (UOM), when setting their font size by direct input into the 'new toolbar component'  input field.

The new `toolbar: "font_size_input_default_unit": "<UOM>"`, option now allows users to use (values) ie, (numbers) without having to manually input the unit of measurement (UOM) after they define the `value`.

This means that users can now specify the UOM in the `tinymce.init` script tag buy configuring the UOM value by changing the default value:* `+pt+` to one of the below possible values:* `+px+`, `+em+`, `+cm+`, `+mm+`

[source, js]
----
tinymce.init({
    selector: "textarea",
    toolbar: "fontsizeinput", "font_size_input_default_unit": "em",
});
----

As a result of this addition, this new option makes it easier and faster for users that are using the 'new toolbar component' to customize their font size within {productname}, as they no longer need to worry about selecting the correct UOM.

=== New group and togglebutton in view

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9523
The release of {productname} 6.4 provides users with new features, such as the improvements to the Advanced Code plugin dialog, which have introduced a group of new buttons to the view bar. A new togglable button has also been added, allowing users to change its icon and active status with the click of a button, and is available in both the modal footer and view header.

Furthermore, this button can differentiate between text and icon, making it much more user friendly as it can show both instead of just the icon like a normal button.

In {productname} 6.4, these new buttons are now available for the *Advanced Code* plugin dialog.

// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480

=== New togglebutton in dialog footer buttons

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9523
The {productname} modal footer and view header dialog have recently added a new improvement by introducing a new togglebutton. This togglebutton allows users to quickly and easily toggle between the footer buttons withing the dialog. This makes navigation easier and more efficient than having to manually search through menus and dropdowns. 

The togglebutton is present in {productname} 6.4 and it helps users to simplify their navigation of the footer buttons dialog. With the introduction of this togglebutton, users are now able to access footer buttons in a more efficient manner. The new togglebutton is a great addition to the {productname} modal footer and view header dialog, as it greatly simplifies the navigation of the footer buttons dialog and increases the overall usability of the feature.

// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480

=== Added toggleFullscreen to dialog API

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9528
{productname} recently added a new *"fullscreen"* toggle button to the Advanced Code Editor Premium plugin, that gives users the ability to expand the Advanced Code Editor dialog toolbar in order to make better use of the available space on their screen, while providing them with a more comfortable working environment.

The toggle button is easily accessible for users that have the Advanced Code Editor Premium plugin by integrating it into their editor by using the `plugins: [ "fullscreen" ]` in pair with the below options.

.Example of fullscreen mode integration within {productname}.
[source, js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: "textarea",
  advcode_inline: true,
  plugins: [
    "code", "fullscreen", 'advcode',
  ],
  toolbar: "code"
});
----

As a result, the toggle button can be found in the top left corner of the Advanced Code Editor Premium toolbar. Once clicked, it will expand the dialog toolbar to fill the entire window, providing a more comprehensive view of the available options. A second click of the toggle button will return the dialog toolbar to its original size.

This option is now available in {productname} 6.4, as part of the core/ui API.

// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480

=== New text-size-increase and text-size-decrease icons

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9530

The {productname} package files have been updated with two new icons that enable users to increase or decrease the size of text in the Advanced Code Editor. The new icons are the `text-size-increase` and `text-size-decrease` icons. These new icons have been added to make it easier for users to adjust the size of the text within the code editor while making it easier to read and understand the code they are writing. 

.Example of `textSizeIncrease` and `textSizeDecrease` integration within {productname}.
[source, js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: "textarea",
	advcode_inline: true,
  plugins: [

  ],
  toolbar: "textSizeIncrease textSizeDecrease"
});
----
[NOTE]
This plugin feature is only available for paid {productname} subscriptions.

=== New xss_sanitization option to allow for XSS sanitization to be disabled

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9600
Currently, we use the `DOMPurify` library to sanitize HTML content when it is inserted into the editor in order to remove unsafe tags & attributes in order to prevent XSS (cross-site scripting). However, customers in some situations have found that the HTML sanitization from the `DOMPurify` library is changing their content in undesired ways. 

To address this issue, we have added a new `xss_sanitization: boolean` editor option. This option is enabled by default which enables sanitization, but can now be set to `false` to disable sanitization. If a customer wishes to prevent their content from being modified by the sanitization, they can now set this option to `false`.

.Example: using `+xss_sanitization+` to turn DOMPurify off and no longer sanitize HTML against XSS attacks
[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  xss_sanitization: false
});
----

[IMPORTANT]
It is important to note that disabling sanitization introduces potential security issues, especially if the server-side XSS sanitization is weak or non-existent and is therefore not recommended.

=== Added top right close 'x' button of the modal dialogs to keyboard navigation

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9520
In previous versions of {productname}, the top right close 'x' button within the modal dialogs were not keyboard-navigable by the Tab key.

With the release of {productname} 6.4, various changes have now made it possible for modal dialogues to be navigated with the Tab key. This is accomplished by adding a `Tabbing.config` to the close 'x' button. The `Tabbing.config` is an object that describes the sequence of focusable elements, their `tabindex` and the `initial focus` within the dialog when it is opened. In addition an optional `firstTabstop` property has also been added to the `Tabbing.config` to specify which element receives focus first when the dialog is opened.

This update enables users to more easily and quickly access the modal dialogues within {productname}, which includes dialogs such as:

* Search and Replace
* Accessibility Checker
* Table Properties
* Help
* Source Code
* URL
* Image
* Url Modal Dialog toolbar buttons. 

[NOTE]
Its worth nothing that the expected result for the Alert and Confrim dialogs is that the `initial focus` is set on the most appropriate button when the dialog is opened; for example, the “OK” button for Alert dialogs, and the “Yes” button for Confirm dialogs.

In {productname} 6.4, these new additions/improvements are now available.
// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480

=== New ui_mode option for editor in scrollable containers support

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9414
A new `ui_mode: 'split'` option for scrollable containers has been introduced with the release of {productname} 6.4.

This new option is designed to give users a better UX, by allowing them to navigate content within their editor easier with the use of the new ui_mode when integrated into their editors. This can be achieved by adding the `ui_mode: 'split'` option to the `tinymce.init()` within the `<script>` tags as below:

.Basic integration for new ui_mode option using `split`
[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  ui_mode: 'split',
  min_height: 1400,
});
----

[TIP]
Its worth noting that when setting the new `ui_mode: 'split'` option for scrollable containers, when setting the height for the `<div class="scrollable-container">` ensure that the height is set to be less than `<` the `min_height` set of the {productname} editor container and by applying the `overflow: scroll;` CSS bevaviour to the `<div class="scrollable-container">`.

The docking behaviour of UI elements is usually only triggered when the page is scrolled. This means that the UI element will stay in the same place relative to the page, no matter how much you scroll. However, with the introduction of the 'split' UI mode, it is now possible to dock the UI element on both page and container scroll. This means that the UI element will stay in the same place relative to the container, regardless of how much you scroll the page or the container itself.

[NOTE]
* If you're using classic mode and sticky toolbars, the toolbar will dock, but it won't be entirely visible in either the window or the scrollable element. This applies to both viewports.
* In inline mode, the toolbar will also dock, but it won't be entirely visible in either the window or the scrollable element.
* ShadowDom is partially supported in this case, where the scrollable container is inside the shadow Root. But in cases when the scrollable container is outside the shadow Root (or an ancestor of it) it is not currently supported within versions of {productname} 6.4 or prior.

[[changes]]
== Changes

{productname} 6.4 also incorporates the following changes:

=== The link plugins context menu items will no longer appear for noneditable links

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9491
In previous versions of {productname}, the link plugin would display the context menu items for `contenteditable="false"` links.

As a consequence, links such as `table of contents` would open the context menu when `clicked`. The behaviour for the `table of contents`, is not designed to allow links to be modified or removed as the `table of contents` plugin is considered as a `contenteditable="false"` element.

To fix this bug, {productname} 6.4 introduced a new check that now verify if the link plugin is opened, which will now block the context menu on `table of contents` from opening upon when the `toc` is clicked. 

As a result, the context menu for the `table of contents` now behaves as expected in {productname} 6.4.
// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480

=== The formatting of contenteditable="false" elements are no longer cloned to new cells while creating new table rows

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9449
In previous versions of {productname}, contenteditable="false" elements such as a *merge tags* could clone the styling to a new table row. In some situations, this cloning would happen during the creation of new table row, where the merge tag prefix would unexpectedly clone the formatting from the previous cell to the new cell.

To correct this issue, {productname} added changes to the *clone logic*, and the cursor position API, which will now return `true`, for any passed `contenteditable=false` elements.

In {productname} 6.4, the formatting of `contenteditable="false"` elements are no longer cloned to new cells while creating new table rows.

=== Changed the color of @dialog-table-border-color, and added right padding to the first cell of dialog table

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9380
An area for improvement was identified during an accessibility audit for the *help menu* within {productname}, which focuses on users that rely on **zoom orient** to help with visibility.

The consequence of the previous UX, meant that adjustments needed to be made to the horizontal lines within the *help menu* table, that seperate each `row`.

To fix this accessibility issue, {productname} 6.4, increased the contrast ratio to `3:1` to each line divider, and changed the `line` color to `#646D78` to further help define were the separations occur in the table.

As a result, the `help menu` is now styled to support a wider range of users, by these new changes implemented.

=== The sidebar element now has accessibility role region when visible and presentation when hidden

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9517
In previous versions of {productname}, Axe-DevTools (web accessibility testing extension) identified that the sidebar element within {productname} was set to `role="complementary"` when the element was either in a visible or hidden state, which created issues with screen readers, as the general rule is that landmarks should not be contained within another landmark.

As a consequence by having the sidebar set to `role="complementary"` for both states, tools such as screen readers in some situations would disable their functionality.

This is important as when a sidebar element is visible, it has an accessibility role of `region`. This ensures the sidebar and its contents are accessible to screen readers and other accessibility tools. This role is important for screen readers to identify the sidebar as a meaningful part of the page. When the sidebar element is hidden, it has a role of presentation, which is used to inform the user that the element is not important and can be safely ignored. 

To fix this issue, changes were made to the role attribute of the sidebar element `(.tox-sidebar)`, which is now set to `role="region"` when it's active state is visible, otherwise it defaults to `role="presentation"` when hidden.

In {productname} 6.4, when the sidebar is either visible or hidden it now passes the accessibility test with Axe-DevTools.

[[bug-fixes]]
== Bug fixes

{productname} 6.4 also includes the following bug fixes:

=== Sometimes the editor would finish initializing before the silver theme would have finished loading

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9556
In earlier versions of {productname}, the properties set for the `renderUI`, caused conflicting issues with the theme rendering load times. As a consequence, the `renderUI` would finish rendering before the {productname} theme `silver` would finish loading.

To fix this bug, {productname}, made changes to the `renderUI` properties that allowed the theme type the to return a `Promise<RenderResult>` instead of `RenderResult`, which corrects the issues found previously. 

In {productname} 6.4, all `renderUI` property loading issues have been resolved.

=== The searchreplace modal would close incorrectly when clicking outside of the alert that pops up when no match is found

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9443
In previous versions of {productname}, the search replace modal would close incorrectly when clicking outside of the alert dialog. The expexted behaviour in previous versions was that an error dialog would open when **no <string> match** was found within the {productname} editor viewport. The identifying issue found was when the user would `click` outside of the error dialog, resulting in the `Find and Replace` modal to closes incorrectly.

In {productname} 6.4, when a **no <string> match** occurs within the {productname} editor viewport, an error banner will render in the `Find and Replace` modal beneith the (Replace with) field.

As a result the when the instance occurs where **no <string> match** is triggered, the user will be prompted with the following warning: *`Could not find the specified string`*.

=== Color picker on toolbar would not update when changing forecolor or backcolor from menu

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9439
In {productname} 6.3, when the https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/6.3-release-notes/#new-color_map_foreground-and-color_map_background-options-store-custom-colors-selected-using-the-text-color-and-background-color-menus[new color map] was introduced, a regression was found that affected the UI for *Color Swatch*.

The regression meant the colors would not render inside the color palette to reflect the selected `color_map_foreground` and `color_map_background` stored. To correct this {productname}, added a register that would store the `last color` for each  specific `node | cell` that will hold this `value` for the color picker pallette.

In {productname} 6.4, when the color picker in the `toolbar` is updated when changing either the `forecolor` or `backcolor` from the `menubar`.

=== The onSetup api function would not run when defining custom group toolbar button

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9496
A bug was discovered that affected the custom group toolbar button `config` in {productname}, due to a missing `Event Behaviour`. As a consequence, the `onSetup` api function would not run as intended when defining a custom group toolbar `button`, resulting in the `console` returning `blank`.

In {productname} 6.4, this bug was fixed by adding a `Event Behaviour` to the toolbar group button that now calls the `api` as intended.

As a result, the `onSetup` function for custom group toolbar buttons now runs correctly in {productname} 6.4.

=== An element could be dropped onto the decendants of an element with a `noneditable` attribute

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9364
In {productname} 6.0, the drag and drop `config` did not check some conditions surrounding element placements using either a drag or drop action.  This affected users running {productname} 6.0, which would affectivly allow decendants of `contenteditable="false"` element to be dropped into another `contenteditable="false"` element.

Fixes were made to ensure that `dragging | dropping` onto `contenteditable="false"` element targets on all browsers is `disabled`. This also includes when the drop target cursor is inside the `contenteditable="true"` element, or just before it.

{productname} 6.4, now prevents the user from having the ability to drag and drop any descendants of a `contenteditable=false element` within another `contenteditable="false"` element.

=== Checkmark did not show in menu colorswatches

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9395
Previous versions of {productname} the known issue, (_https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/6.3-release-notes/#checkmark-over-the-current-background-color-is-not-displayed-when-inline-formatting-is-applied-in-a-certain-order[checkmark-over-the-current-background-color-is-not-displayed-when-inline-formatting-is-applied-in-a-certain-order]_) was identified. As a consequence, when text was formatted in the following order, the *checkmark* over the currently active background color would not display in the Background color swatch menu:

. When the user appled inline formatting, such as *bold* or _Italic_.
. After applying a forground(text) color.
. After applying a background color.

To fix this bug, {productname} introduced a new variable to store the node `selection` and `color` format value, which then renders a checkmark to appear in both the toolbar and menubar for both the `forecolor` and `background` color.

As a result, in {productname} 6.4, checkmarks now work as expected when using the color swatch in both the toolbar and menubar.

=== The foreground and background menu icons would not properly update to display the last used color

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9497
In previous versions of {productname}, while the foreground and background icons were updating in the toolbar dropdown, the menu icons in the menubar dropdown would not update the colour option in the format menu after the user applied colors to the selected text, despite the fact that this was the expected behaviour. While workarounds where available, this deviation from the expected functionality caused confusion for some users until the fix was applied.

To correct this, {productname} added a new set icon fill function to the nested menu item spec, to ensure that the icon is filled when a color is selected from the format menu.

In {productname} 6.4, this issue has be rectified, which now ensures that the foreground and background menu icons now accurately reflects the last used color within the menu dropdown swatch.

// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480

=== Added new setIconFill function to NestedMenuItemInstanceApi

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9497
In previous versions of {productname} up until the changes and improvements made with the release of v6.4, the foreground and background menu icons would not properly update to display the last used color, as outlined in the above.

To facilitate this change, {productname} has added a new `setIconFill` function to the `NestedMenuItemInstanceAPI`, which allows users to set the fill color of an icon when the user selects an option from the format menu. This ensures that the menu icon changes to accurately reflect the user's selection.

In {productname} 6.4, these new functions allow the foreground and background menu icons to function as expected.

// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480

=== Pasting links to text would sometimes not generate the correct undo stack on safari

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9489
In previous versions of {productname}, pasting links to `text` selections in Safari would sometimes not generate the correct undo stack.

This is due to Safari not supporting the ability to track changes to a page within the editor, which can create issues for users when pasting links to `text` selections, as the undo stack would not be able to recognise the link as a separate element, resulting in the undo action when called, to not remove the hyperlink.

To fix this issue, a workaround was implemented in {productname} 6.4, that now bypasses the default paste functionality for this undo function.

In {productname} 6.4, pasting links to text selections now generates the correct undo stack on Safari.

// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480

=== Toolbar split buttons in advlist plugin to show the correct state when the cursor is in a checklist

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-5167
In previous versions of {productname}, when a cursor was placed within a checklist item, the icon for both the checklist and the bullet list would show as `active`. This created UX issues, as having both buttons showing a `active` state was confusing for the user, specifically for navigation purposes when using checklists from the `advlist` plugin.

To fix this issue, {productname} added improvements to the list configuration to checks a new set of conditionals which would determine if the `node` selected matched the parent `node` within the checklist. If the match returns as `true`, the (api) will set only the checklist icon to a `active` state.

As a result, the checklist `icon` in {productname} 6.4, related to the `advlist` plugin will only appear in a `active` state, when the `node` checklist meets the new conditions implemented.

=== Dragging transparent elements into transparent blocks elements could produce invalid nesting of transparents

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9231
Dragging or dropping block `links` into other `links` was producing invalid nesting of other transparents such as `anchors`. As a result, these transparent elements would produce `anchor` tags within other `anchor` tags, which is not a general practice. As an example `links` and `anchors` that are defined to an element, must not be nested within or contain any other element and vice versa.

Changes were implemented in {productname} 6.4 to fix this issue to ensure that any invalid child anchor elements that try to reproduce this action are unwrapped when the editor verifies another transparent has been dropped into another transparent (anchor) element.

In {productname} 6.4, dragging content such as `links` into other `links` will now produce *valid* HTML `output` after a drag operation occurs which will be consistent across all browsers.

=== The editor.insertContent API would insert contents inside noneditable elements if the selection was inside the element

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9462
In previous versions of {productname}, the settings for the `contentEditable` property in the editor root was set to `false`. As a consequence, the user could insert content using `api` commands to edit a `contenteditable="false"` root element.

To fix this bug, in {productname} 6.4, a blocker was added to the `editor.insertContent` api and `mceInsertContent` command, which stops `contenteditable="false"` root elements from being edited.

In {productname} 6.4, inserting contents inside a `contenteditable="false"` element while the selection is inside another element, is no longer possible.

=== Closing a dialog would scroll down the document in Safari

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9148
While using previous versions of {productname}, `clicking` away to dismiss the *Search* and *Replace* dialog within Safari would scroll the page to the bottom of the editor. As a result the user would have to manually scroll back to the original `focus` area each time the steps above were executed.

To correct this issue, a new Css.set was implemented to keep the `focus` on the DOM container in the initial scroll document position. 

In {productname} 6.4, when the user `clicks` away to dismiss the *Search* and *Replace* dialog within Safari, the focus now returns to the editor and the scroll does not change position within the editor.

=== Inline headers would not work in some situations when the editor was moved too far right horizontally
// @KKS note to self, this still needs to be verified by QA.
// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-8977
// Cause, Consequence, Fix, Result
// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480

=== Quick toolbars were incorrectly rendered during the dragging of contenteditable="false" elements

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9305
The quickbar was displaying incorrectly during a drag and drop `action` for contenteditable="false" elements. As a consequence, during the movement of a contenteditable="false" element, the selection was updated, which triggered a *NodeChange*. This selection update would cause an absence of the caret location during a dragging or dropping event.

To fix this bug, {productname} 6.4 added a new check to identify when the user is dragging a contenteditable="false" element, which blocks the quickbar from rendering.

As a result, the quickbar no longer opens in {productname} v6.4+, when the user is dragging a contenteditable="false" elements.

=== Selection of images, hrs, tables or noneditable elements was possible if they were within a noneditable element

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9473
In previous versions of {productname}, `contenteditable="false"` elements that were nested within another such as a element set with the `contenteditable="false"` attribute, would avoid the `contenteditable="false"` guidelines set. As a consequence, selection of images, hrs, tables or `contenteditable="false"` elements was possible if they were nested within a `contenteditable="false"` element.

Improvements were made to the `SelectionOverride` to now check if the DOM parent node is either set as a `contenteditable="true"` element or as a `contenteditable="false"` element.

In {productname} 6.4, elements with `contenteditable="false"` attributes can no longer be selected when they are children of another `contenteditable="false"` attribute, such as:

.Example of `contenteditable="false"` elements
[source,HTML]
----
<div contenteditable="false">noneditables div text</div>
<div>editable div text</div>
----

=== Ranged deletion of formatted text using selection or keyboard shortcut would sometimes cause Blink and Webkit browsers to insert interpreted tags upon typing, which may result in inconsistent tags

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9302
Blink & Webkit browsers (Chrome & Safari) were deleting the contents of inline formats which would cause the format to be lost and not retained. As a consequence, this issue would impact the semantics and visuals for the *HTML* document, which is not be visible to the user.

A override fix already exists for _character-by-character_ deletion using backspace/delete keys with a collapsed selection. However, this particular bug persists when the format is deleted when there is a ranged selection that starts at the beginning of the inline format(s) and encompasses at least the entirety of the inline format(s). The bug also occurs when deletion is done using common keyboard shortcuts including `Ctrl/Alt + Backspace`, `Ctrl/Alt + Delete`, and `Cmd + Backspace`.

In {productname} 6.4, two new key overrides have been added to:

. Check that a `non-collapsed` selection satisfies the conditions set (specifically for a ranged selection using `backspace/delete`).
. Check a range of conditions *before* continuing (for keyboard shortcut `backspace/delete`).

As a result, the ranged selection for backspace/delete now check that all of the original formats at the cursor selection *start*, before deletion, are retained with either the native browser behaviour or a caret. For keyboard shortcuts that are using backspace/delete, will create a new unformatted caret which prevents browsers from inserting interpolated formats.

=== Visual characters were rendered inside noneditable elements

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9474
In previous versions of {productname}, a bug was found that affected the `visual characters` plugin. As a consequence, the visual characters selecter would render inside `contenteditable="false"` elements after the plugin was applied to the editor.

To fix this issue, a conditional filter was added which identifies, if an element is either a `contenteditable="true"` element or a `contenteditable="false"` element to its decendants.  If the element matches as a `contenteditable="false"` element to itself or decendants, the `visual character` plugin will remove the highlighted selecter from within the `dom` viewport.

As a result, in {productname} 6.4, visual characters no longer render inside `contenteditable="false"` elements.

=== Lists in a noneditable root were incorrectly editable using list API commands, toolbar buttons and menu items

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9458
In previous versions of {productname}, a bug was found that affected the `lists` and `advlist` plugins when the {productname} editor body was set to `contentEditable = 'false'`. The consequence meant that `lists` that were set as `contenteditable="false"` elements could be modified by using list API commands, toolbar buttons and menu items.

The fix involved implementing a new process to  check the element conditions.  The check now looks to  identify if the `lists` or `advlists` in the DOM are set to be either `contentEditable = 'false'` or `contentEditable = 'true'.

As a result, in {productname} 6.4, `lists` and `advlist` plugins that are set as `contentEditable = 'false'` elements can no longer be modified by using list API commands, toolbar buttons and menu items.

=== Color picker dialog would not update the preview color if the hex input value was prefixed with # symbol

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9457
In previous versions of {productname}, the preview sample box within the color picker dialod would not render. This issue could be replicated when a hex `value` was prefixed with a `#` symbol before the hex `value`.

Example of a `incorrect` vs `correct` value input:

* `#BDE123`: Incorrect hex value input.
* `BDE123`: Correct hex value input.

In order to fix this bug, {productname} 6.4, not detects if the user inserts a `#` symbol before the hex `value`, which removes the leading `#` prefix before rendering to the color picker component.

In {productname} 6.4, the color picker works as expected when using hex `values`.

=== Table cell selection was possible even if the element was in a noneditable root element

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9459
Previous versions of {productname}, table cells set with the `contenteditable="false"` element properties could still be modified. This was because the `contenteditable="true"` element property settings were set to `false` in the root. This meant that any table UI actions, commands or table selections could still affect any tables that were within that specific `contenteditable="false"` element root.

{productname} 6.4, introduced a blocker that is executed when tables are inside a `contenteditable="false"` element root.

In {productname} 6.4, all table UI actions, commands and selections have been `disabled` for tables when either the table or the editor body have been set as `contenteditable="false"` elements.

=== Table commands were modifying tables in a noneditable root element

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9459
In versions of {productname}, prior to 6.4, tables could be modified by using `execCommands` when tables are placed within a `contenteditable="false"` root element.

As a consequence, a bug was identified that by using the `execCommands`, which are provided by {productname}, the user could modify the table element regardless of it being nested within a `contenteditable="false"` root element. This was made possible by by overriding the `contenteditable="false"` element settings by using the `execCommand`'s' to trigger the `action` event.

To fix this bug, {productname} 6.4, made improvements to the DOM `Commands` API that now blocks all Table UI actions via the `execCommands` when a `contenteditable="false"` element selection is highlighted inside a `contenteditable="false"` root.

As a result, `contenteditable="false"` elements such as tables cannot have their properties overridden by using the `execCommands`.

=== Fake carets were rendered for noneditable elements and tables in a noneditable root element

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9459
In previous versions of {productname}, `fake` carets that are within a `contenteditable="false"` element, would render as a `highlighted` node, when nested within another `contenteditable="false"` element, this would occured when the content was placed within a `table` placed in the root element.

As a consequence, `fake` caret/s would be visibly highlighted within the editor viewport,  which would allow content to be inserted into the element when the table was selected by using either the keyboard and mouse function commands.

To fix this {productname} 6.4, added a new function to the Utils API that filters any content that is considered as a `fake caret` element, which now disables the users ability to add/insert or modify the content contained within the `contenteditable="false"` element node space.

As a result, any `contenteditable="false"` elements that are nested within another `contenteditable="false"` element root that are nested within `table` elements, can no longer be edited in {productname} 6.4.

=== Textareas with scrollbars in dialogs would not render rounded corners correctly on some browsers

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9331
In previous versions of {productname}, the source code visible UI boarder would not render correctly in some browsers.

As a consequence, when viewing text-areas that contain `scrollbars` within dialogs, the `focus` visible boarder was not rendering the corners inside the dialog.

To correct this issue, {productname} 6.4, introduced a new text-area wrapper that fixes the issues with the `boarder-color, radius, style and width` that directly affects the `focus` render element for the dialog.  In addition `overflow: hidden;`, has been added to clip the scrollbars to the border-radius.

As a result, the `focus` dialog boarder now renders correctly in {productname} 6.4.

// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480

=== It was possible to open links inside the editor if the editor root was noneditable

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9470
Setting the `contenteditable` property to the editor root to `false` such as the below example, would result in `contenteditable="false"` elements meant that `links` could be navigable.

[source, js]
----
setup: (editor) => {
    editor.on('preinit', () => {
        editor.getBody().contentEditable = false;
    })
}
----

As a result, links could be opened within the `iframe` element.

In {productname} 6.4, links can no longer be navigable by clicking on them while they are inside a `contenteditable="false"` root, after a blocker was implemented to avoid this event `action`.

In {productname} 6.4, all links in a `contenteditable="false"` now behave as expected.

=== Inline boundary was rendered for noneditable inline boundary elements

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9471
Inline boundaries for `contenteditable="false"` elements were rendering styling in previous versions of {productname} 6.4 after the user `selected` before and after the `contenteditable="false"` elements node. The expected behaviour is that `contenteditable="false"` elements should *not* have inline boundaries when a caret is inside an `contenteditable="false"` anchor or root.

Added a predicate check for inline boundaries before they render, and additional tests for `selections` for some special cases surrounding particular `contenteditable="false"` elements.

In {productname} 6.4, it is now not possible to highlight inline boundary elements that are classified as a `contenteditable="false"` content element.

=== Clicking on a disabled split button will no longer call the onAction callback

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9504
A bug was found in versions of {productname} prior to the 6.4 release, that would call the `onAction` callback for *split buttons* regardless of the action being `disabled`. This meant it was possible for the user to emit the `onAction` call wether or not the `disable` function was enabled or not.

As a fix to the issue, {productname} 6.4 introduced a new conditional check to identify *if* the button is `enabled` or `disabled`. If the button is set to `enabled` then {productname} executes the secondary check, which will identify wether or not the button is a *split button*.  Split buttons are classified as “special buttons”,  as they are unique and require both `advlists` and `dropdowns` to function, this makes them more complex than traditional buttons.

In {productname} 6.4, clicking on a disabled split button won't call the `onAction` callback anymore.

=== The "Edit Link" dialog incorrectly retrieved the URL value when opened immediately after the link insertion

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-7993
A bug was found within the context menu and dialog when inserting `links` in previous versions of {productname}. The issue resulted in the `open link` being deactivated within the context menu and dialog when the user would execute a specific chain of clicks. Such as:

.Example
====
. Opening the editor
. Type “test1 test2 test3” into the editor
. Double click to select “test2”
. Use the context menu to insert a new link over the text “test2”
. Add a valid URL
. Press `Enter`
. Without taking any other action, right click on “test2”

In this example the bug would deactivate the `open link` button within the context menu and dialog, which removes the users ability to reopen the “open link” dialog.
====

The fix now allows all three link-plugins to work within the context menu items.

In {productname} 6.4, when the user executes right `mouse click` on the link selection immediately after attaching a link to a `<string>`, the link-plugins now work as expected.

=== Editor commands ForwardDelete and Delete was deleting contents inside noneditable elements

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9477
Previously, when using the forwarddelete or delete keys in earlier versions of {productname}, the contents within `contenteditable="false"` elements were deleted. This meant that if there were nested elements within a `contenteditable="false"` root element that were also set to `contenteditable="false"`, they could be deleted from the root element.

To resolve this issue, {productname} 6.4 included several enhancements to prevent all commands and keyboard functions, including delete/forwarddelete, from affecting `contenteditable="false"` content. These changes also updated the editor selection `isEditable` function to prioritize fake selections first.

Consequently, in {productname} 6.4, using the forwarddelete or delete keys on `contenteditable="false"` elements within a `contenteditable="false"` element will no longer delete the contents within the `contenteditable="false"` elements.

// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480

=== Backspace or delete keys was deleting contents inside noneditable elements

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9477
In the previous versions of {productname}, when utilizing the backspace or delete keys, they would delete the contents inside `contenteditable="false"` elements.

As a consequence, elements nested within a `contenteditable="false"` root element set to `contentEditable= false;`, were able to be removed/deleted from the `contenteditable="false"` root element. To fix this issue, {productname} 6.4 introduced various improvements to block all commands and keyboard functions such as `delete/backspace` from being applied to `contenteditable="false"` content. 

The changes made to {productname} 6.4 included updates to the editor selection `isEditable` function, which now prioritizes fake selections first.

As a result, in {productname} 6.4, when using the backspace or delete function keys on `contenteditable="false"` elements within a `contenteditable="false"` element, the contents within the `contenteditable="false"` elements will no longer be deleted. 

// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480

=== Inserting newlines inside an editable element inside a noneditable root would sometimes try to split the editable element

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9461
In previous versions of {productname}, inserting newlines inside an `contentEditable= true;` element while it was inside a `contentEditable= false;` root would sometimes try to split the `contentEditable= true;` element. 

As a consequence, when child block elements set to `contentEditable=true;` such as a `<p>` tag were nested within the `contentEditable= false;` element root, the editor would try to split the child block element when the user hit the `enter` command. 

As the paragraph tag is intended to be a block for `text`, it is classified as `semantically incorrect` to split a paragraph block element.
In this particular instance, child elements in {productname} such as the `<p>` tag would split the block element resulting in a new block (such as a new paragraph) to be created inside the paragraph when a user attempted to edit it inside a `contentEditable= false;` root element. 

Fixes were introduced with the release of {productname} 6.4, that:

* Prevents editing host elements like `<p contenteditable="true">paragraph text</p>` in a `contentEditable= false;` root to be split.
* Prevents editing hosts elements inside a `contentEditable= false;` root to be split.

As a result, when a root element is set to `contentEditable= false;`, any `contentEditable= true;` elements inside that root element such as `<p>` tag will no longer try to split the `contentEditable= true;` element.

=== Creating a list in a table cell when the caret is in front of an anchor element would not properly include the anchor in the list.

//https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-6853
In previous versions of {productname}, a bug was causing issues with `links` while they were nested within table-cells. As a consequence, it was found that when creating a `num-list` or `bullet-list` to the left (node) of a `link` that was nested within a table cell the `list` would *not* include the created `link` within the `num or bullet-list` as expected. 

To fix this bug, the table cell now checks *If* the caret position is in front of an *anchor element*, `if` (true), then the table cell will include the anchor in the `list`.

In {productname} 6.4, anchor elements are included inside `lists` while nested within table cells.

=== Dragging and dropping noneditable elements on table borders would remove the element on drop

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9021
In previous versions of {productname}, dragging and dropping `contentEditable= false;` elements on table borders would create issues during the drop action.

As a consequence, this would result in the `contentEditable= false;` element being deleted after the `action` when dropped onto the borderline within the table cell.
To fix this issue, {productname} 6.4, introduced a new `isActive` api to the handler for dragger, that checks if the event `isActive` or not, which then hides the resize bar during the dragging event, which now prevents content from being dropped onto table bars.

In {productname} 6.4, dragging an inline `contentEditable= false;` element onto the border inside a table, now moves it into a neighbouring cell instead of deleting it.

// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480

=== Noneditable elements would be removed when dragged and dropped within a noneditable root

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9558
In previous version of {productname}, dragging ``contentEditable= false;` elements into a `contentEditable= false;` root would remove the elements `contentEditable= false;` attributes.

As this is not the expected behaviour for a `contentEditable= false;` element or root, this bug in particular, created issues in situations such as: *(a)* when the editor body was set to `contentEditable= false;`, and *(b)* when a `contentEditable= false;` element is dragged and dropped into a table element that is within a `contentEditable= false;` root, which would result in the `contentEditable= false;` attributes blocks being deleted from the element that was dropped.

To fix this issue, improvements were made to the drag and drop function that checks if the `dom` element `isEditable` to its `parentElement`.

In {productname} 6.4, `contentEditable= false;` elements now preserve their `contentEditable= false;` attributes if they are dragged and dropped within a `contentEditable= false;` root.

// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480

=== Formatting could be applied or removed on noneditable list items inside a noneditable root

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9563
In a `contentEditable= false;` root, when selecting multiple lines from lists, it was possible to add formatting to the selection such as `*bold*` and `_italic_`. As a consequence, this would allow contents that are considered `contentEditable= false;` to be modified which is not the expected behaviour for `contentEditable= false;` elements within the root.

To fix this bug, {productname}, disabled list formatting, if the list is in within a `contentEditable= false;` root

In {productname} 6.4, a selection of multiple lines from lists can no longer be formatted when inside a `contentEditable= false;` root.

// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480

=== Annotation would not be removed if the annotation was immediately deleted after being created

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9399
In previous versions of {productname}, the annotations behaviour was not working as expected when using `comments`.

As a consequence, the annotation (highlighted-text-selection) would not be removed from the text selection, if the annotation was immediately deleted after being created.

While applying a fix for this issue, it was identified that this was a regression created when {productname} fixed issue: _`Change the annotation api to avoid dom mutation in plugins using it`_, which adjusts the selection in the way that it is _impossible_, to retain the selected word. 

However, with the release of {productname} 6.4, after immediately deleting annotations after they are created, they will no longer will be retained on the text selection.


// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480

=== Inserting a link for a selection from quickbars didn't preserve formatting

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9593
// Cause, Consequence, Fix, Result
In previous versions of {productname}, inserting a link for a text selection from `quickbars` did not preserve formatting.

As a consequence, when formatting the selection such as with `*bold*` or `_italic_`, then inserting the link via the `quickbars` plugin, the link would result in the applied formatting been removed from the text selection.

To fix this issue, improvements were made to the conditional check that is responsible for returning `optionals` when the anchor is called to gather the text selection.

As a result, formatting after pasting a link from `quickbars` is now preserved to the selection {productname} 6.4.

// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480

=== Inline dialog position was not correct when the editor wasn't inline and was contained in a fixed or absolute positioned element

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9554
In previous versions of {productname}, a bug was found that affected the inline dialog position for elements set to either a `fixed` or `absolute` position.  As a consequence, this bug in particular, presented itself when the editor wasn't `inline`, which resulted in the dialog being rendered outside of the {productname} viewport `bounds`.

A fix for this bugs was implemented in {productname} 6.4, that corrected this issue, resulting in the `inline` dialog working as expected with this release.

// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480

=== Sticky toolbars would not have fade transition when undocking in classic iframe mode

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9408
In previous versions of {productname}, a css selector which was overriding the transition property for the sticky toolbar in iframe mode was causing visual issues with the user interface.

As a consequence, the sticky toolbar would immediately render off-screen rather than fading out using a css `transition` animation.

In {productname} 6.4, the selector configuration was updated when the editor is docked, resulting in the sticky toolbar in classic `iframe` mode now fading out correctly when the editor is out of view, similar to how it transitions in `inline` mode.
// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480

=== Inserting elements that was not valid within the closest editing host would incorrectly split the editing host

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9595
In previous versions of {productname}, inserting invalid child blocks into a parent block element would create issues with the editing host element.

As a consequence, the editing host element would incorrectly split itself into multiple elements. 

To fix this issue, with the release of {productname} 6.4, pasted elements are now instead unwrapped inside the target element rather than being wrapped.

In {productname} 6.4, pasting blocks that are invalid children of a `contentEditable= true;` blocks will no longer split that block, but instead unwrap the blocks to fit within the specific `contentEditable= true;` block.

// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480

=== color_cols option was not respected in the forecolor or backcolor color swatches

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9560
In previous versions of {productname}, the logic for specifying the number of columns in the `forecolor` and `backcolor` swatches was updated with the release of {productname} 6.3.

As a consequence, this logic didn't use the color_cols option in {productname} v6.3

[source, js]
----
tinymce.init({
    selector: "textarea",
    plugins: "table code",
    toolbar: "forecolor backcolor tableprops",
    color_cols: 7, // <-- option was not respected
});
----

To fix this issue, the default value for `color_cols_foreground` and `color_cols_background` was updated to use color_cols if it is set within the `tinymce.init` script, and otherwise use the correct default number of columns.

In {productname} 6.4, the correct number of columns is respected in the forecolor and backcolor colour swatches.
// https://notion.so/tinycloud/Four-words-to-live-by-96e307110aaa4137b94f9ba12874d480

=== Drag and dropping the last noneditable element out of its parent block would not properly pad the parent block element

// https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-9606
// Cause, Consequence, Fix, Result
In previous versions of {productname}, dragging and dropping `contentEditable= false;` elements into another block elements would cause issues with the original parent block. As a consequence, the parent block element where the `contentEditable= false;` element was dragged from would leave the parent block as a `contentEditable= false;` element, as it was not discarding the contents when the element was transferred.

As a fix, {productname} 6.4, added a new condition which validates a set of conditions the check if the parent block element is within a `parentNode` and is a block element, in which it will trigger a action to remove elements with padding that meet this condition. 

In {productname} 6.4, dragging and dropping elements that are `contentEditable= false;` out of they're parent blocks now correctly pad the parent block element.

// == Bug fixes

// {productname} 6.4.2 also includes the following bug fixes:

=== Setting an invalid unit in the `fontsizeinput` changed it to the default value instead of reverting it to the previous, and valid, value.

In previous versions of {productname}, when an invalid value was entered into the `fontsizeinput` toolbar component, the value was not parsed and both the value and unit were set to their default values: _0_ and _pt_ respectively. 

As a consequence, entering an invalid value set selected text, or the insertion point, to _0pt_.

In {productname} 6.4.2, if an invalid string is entered in the `fontsizeinput` entry field, the `fontsizeinput` value reverts to the previous, valid, value.

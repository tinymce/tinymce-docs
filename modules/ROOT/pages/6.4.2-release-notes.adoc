// == Bug fixes

// {productname} 6.4.2 also includes the following bug fixes:

=== The ‘Comments > Delete all conversations’ menu item was enabled even when no comments were added

In previous versions of {productname}, if the Premium plugin, xref:introduction-to-tiny-comments.adoc[Tiny Comments] was also running, {productname} did not check the state of the comments section.

Consequently, the _Comments > Delete all conversations_ menu item was not disabled even when the comments section was empty.

With this update, if xref:introduction-to-tiny-comments.adoc[Tiny Comments] is running, {productname} now checks the comments section state and this menu item is now, as expected, disabled when the {productname} comments section contains no comments.

== Bug fixes

{productname} 6.4.2 also includes the following bug fixes:


=== The `urlinput` dialog component would not open the type-ahead dropdown when the input value was reset to an empty string.

In previous versions of {productname}, a console error was thrown when the _Source_ field of the *Insert Media* dialog was reset.

As a consequence, the dropdown list of suggested URLs did not expand.

To fix this issue, the code for the `urlinput` component that is responsible for gathering the correct dropdown items was updated.

As a result, the URL suggestions dropdown list now expands even on the empty _Source_ field. As well, the host browser’s console no longer returns errors.

=== Selection was not correctly scrolled horizontally into view when using the `selection.scrollIntoView` API.

In previous versions of {productname}, the `scrollToMarker` function manually calculated how much should be scrolled vertically. The horizontal scroll amount, however, was set to a specific value: left of the marker.

As a consequence, in some circumstances {productname} editor instances did not scroll to the correct horizontal position.

To fix this, instead of manually calculating the vertical and horizontal marker position, {productname} 6.4.2 now uses a native `scrollIntoView` function to keep the marker in the viewport.

=== Tab navigation no longer incorrectly stops at menu buttons within toolbar groups.

In previous versions of {productname}, menu buttons were assigned an internal attribute.

When the More toolbar button — … — was opened, and the, now-visible, floating toolbar contained a menu button, using the Tab key to navigate through the floating toolbar icons would, because of this attribute and in some circumstances, stop progressing through the toolbar and, sometimes, enter a selection loop.

For this update this internal attribute has been removed and using the Tab key to activate floating toolbar icons progresses through these icons as expected.

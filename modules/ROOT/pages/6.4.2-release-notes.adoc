// == Bug fixes

// {productname} 6.4.2 also includes the following bug fixes:

=== Tab navigation no longer incorrectly stops at menu buttons within toolbar groups.

In previous versions of {productname}, having a menu button in the “more” floating toolbar, would cause issues with the navigation behaviour.

As a consequence, Tabbing stopped at the menu button, rather than stopping at the toolbar group’s first button.

As a result, Tabbing now correctly stops at the first button within a toolbar group.

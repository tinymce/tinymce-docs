[[changes]]
== Changes

{productname} 6.5 also incorporates the following changes:

=== The anchor element (`a`) could contain block child elements when the editor schema was set to *HTML 4*.
//#TINY-9805

In previous versions of {productname}, the anchor element — `<a>` — could have block elements added as children when the schema was set to *HTML 4*.

Consequently, applying a heading element (for example, an `<h1>` element) to a link within a table caption would affect the editor view, even though the table caption tag was not included in the serialized content.

To address this issue, an update was made to the editor’s HTML4 schema: block child elements are now not allowed in anchor tags.

As a result, applying block formatting to link content in {productname} 6.5, should no longer have any impact.

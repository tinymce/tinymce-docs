[[additions]]
== Additions
{productname} 6.5 also includes the following additions:

=== Toolbar and menu items were not disabled correctly when selecting elements with a `contenteditable="false"` attribute inside an editor root with a `contenteditable="false"` attribute set.
//#TINY-9669

In previous versions of {productname}, an issue was identified where toolbar and menu items were not presenting as disabled when the contents of elements with a `contenteditable= "false"` attribute were selected from inside a editor root with a `contenteditable="false"` attribute set.

In this circumstance, toolbar buttons and menu items appeared as enabled even though the buttons and menu items were in a disabled state based on the user’s current selection.

{productname} 6.5 now explicitly disables toolbar buttons and menu items based on the user’s selection.

In addition, if the contents of elements with a `contenteditable="true"` attribute are selected in the same circumstance, the toolbars and menu items are re-enabled.

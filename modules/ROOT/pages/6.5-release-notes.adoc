[[changes]]
== Changes

{productname} 6.5 also incorporates the following changes:

=== The `caption`, `address` and `dt` elements could contain block child elements when the editor schema was set to *HTML 4*.
//#TINY-9768

In previous versions of {productname}, the `<caption>`, `<dt>` and `<address>` elements could have block elements added as children when the schema was set to *HTML 4*.

The *HTML 4* schema does not support this and, as a consequence, {productname} documents containing such child elements did not validate against HTML 4-specific parsers and validators.

In {productname} 6.5, the editor’s *HTML 4* schema has been corrected. Block elements are now, correctly, considered invalid inside such elements and are automatically unwrapped out of the elements noted above.

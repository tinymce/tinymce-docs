[[bug-fixes]]
== Bug fixes

{productname} 6.5 also includes the following bug fixes:

=== In some specific circumstances when Google Chrome was the host browser, when the insertion point was placed after a table, adding a newline did not generate the expected newline.
//#TINY-9813

Previously, when Google Chrome was the host browser, there were circumstances where adding a newline character after a table did not produce the expected outcome (that is, a new line).

When the insertion point was positioned after a table, it was placed in the `<body>` at offset 1 instead of within any of its children.

As a result, when an element with a `contenteditable= "false"` attribute came after it, it was deemed invalid to insert a newline at that position. Consequently, no newline was added.

As of this release, {productname} now recognises this position as valid, and the expected root blocks are inserted.

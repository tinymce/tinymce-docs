== Accompanying Premium Plugin changes

The following premium plugin updates were released alongside {productname} 6.5.

=== Merge Tags 1.3.0

The {productname} 6.5 release includes an accompanying release of the **Merge Tags** premium plugin.

**Merge Tags** 1.3.0 includes one fix:

=== Right clicking on a merge tag instance presented different highlighting depending on the host browser.
//#TINY-9848

In previous versions of {productname}, when users right-clicked on a merge tag, the highlighting within the merge tag selection varied, depending on the host browser.

This resulted in an inconsistent end-user experience.

{productname} 6.5 no longer uses a browserâ€™s default highlighting of the merge tag. Instead, {productname} 6.5 introduces {productname}-specific styles. These styles highlight the merge tag consistently across different browsers.

{productname} now presents end-users with uniform merge tag highlighting across all supported browsers.

For information on the **Merge Tags** plugin, see: xref:mergetags.adoc[Merge Tags].

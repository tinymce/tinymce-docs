[[additions]]
== Additions
{productname} 6.5 also includes the following additions:

=== New `help_accessibility` option which displays the keyboard shortcut to access the help functionality in the statusbar.
//#TINY-9379

In previous versions of {productname}, keyboard users without screen readers had no indicator of how to access the help menu. However, users that used screen readers would get announcements on accessing the help menu. 

As a consequence, keyboard users could only see the help button, but could not access it unless they were aware of the keyboard shortcuts such as `‚å•+0`.

To fix this, {productname} introduced a new option `help_accessibility`, which defaults to `true`, that adds a shortcut indicator in the status bar to indicate the keyboard shortcut for the help menu.

In {productname} 6.5, keyboard users are now aware of the shortcut to access the help menu via the editor's statusbar.

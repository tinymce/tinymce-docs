[[additions]]
== Additions
{productname} 6.5 also includes the following additions:

=== New `DataTransfer`, `DataTransferContent`, `DataTransferEvent`, and `DataTransferMode` APIs to handle creating and manipulating `DataTransfer` objects.
//#TINY-9601

Dragging and dropping `contenteditable="false"` elements within {productname} emits dragstart, drop, and dragend events as expected. However, in previous versions of {productname}, these drag events had their `dataTransfer` property set to null, whereas according to web standards it should be set to a `DataTransfer` object holding the drag operation's data.

As a consequence, integrators were unable to view and manipulate the HTML drag data in these drag events.

In {productname} 6.5, dragstart, drop, and dragend events now have their `dataTransfer` property populated with a `DataTransfer` object whose text/html data holds the outerHTML of the `contenteditable="false"` element being dragged. Additionally, a custom mode module has been implemented to ensure that the `DataTransfer` object is in read/write mode in dragstart, read-only mode in drop, and protected mode in dragend, as per standard.

[NOTE]
Integrators who wish to manipulate the HTML drag data should do so in the dragstart event using the `DataTransfer.setData` method.

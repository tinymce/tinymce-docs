== Accompanying Premium Plugin changes

The following premium plugin updates were released alongside {productname} 6.5.

=== Checklist 2.0.5

The {productname} 6.5 release includes an accompanying release of the **Checklist** premium plugin.

**Checklist** 2.0.5 includes one fix:

=== Checklist toggling was possible on `contenteditable = "false"` elements
//#TINY-9469

In earlier versions of {productname}, the Checklist plugin allowed toggling on elements with the `contenteditable = "false"` attribute.

As a consequence, lists nested within a `contenteditable = "false"` section of the editor could be converted into a checklist.

To address this issue, the Checklist button has now been disabled for `contenteditable = "false"` sections in the {productname} 6.5.

As a result, it is no longer possible to apply the Checklist functionality to `contenteditable = "false"` sections.

[[accompanying-premium-plugin-changes]]
== Accompanying Premium Plugin changes

The following premium plugin updates were released alongside {productname} 6.5.

=== Accessibility Checker 3.2.0

The {productname} 6.5 release includes an accompanying release of the **Accessibility Checker** premium plugin.

**Accessibility Checker** 3.2.0 includes the following fixes, additions, and improvements.

=== No longer allow attempting to fix a table’s lack of headers if the table has no cells.
//#TINY-9753

Previously, the Accessbility Checker plugin assumed a table had at least one row. As a consequence it would, consequent to attempting to produce a user-visible error regarding a table having no header rows, throw an internal error when it checked a table that had no cells at all.

NOTE: this error was sent to the Console but no errors or alerts were presented to end-users.

As of Accessibility Checker 3.2.0, the plugin no longer attempts to fix errors in tables with no rows. The user experience is unchanged, but Console errors are no longer generated in this circumstance.

For information on the **Accessibility Checker** plugin, see: xref:accessibility.adoc[Accessibility Checker].
=== Advanced Code Editor 3.3.0

The {productname} 6.5 release includes an accompanying release of the **Advanced Code Editor** premium plugin.

**Advanced Code Editor** 3.3.0 includes two fixes:

=== The _Copy code_ button was incorrectly styled within the Advanced Code Editor.
//#TINY-9698

In previous versions of {productname}, the _Copy code_ button, presented as part of the Advanced Code Editor, was styled incorrectly. Specifically, it was missing the grey background used in other, equivalent, buttons.

This was caused by an incorrect CSS setting. The setting, `borderless: true`, should not have been applied. As a consequence, the button wasn't correctly styled. 

In {productname} 6.5, the `borderless: true` setting has been removed and the button is now correctly styled.

=== The Advanced Code Editor now preserves selected font size.
//#TINY-9701

Previously, font size changes in the Advanced Code Editor were not preserved when the user exited the editor in inline mode.

In **Advanced Code Editor** 3.3.0 a fix has been implemented to address this. Now, when users change the font size in the Advanced Code Editor and the user closes the Code Editor, the font size changes are preserved.

The changed font size setting presents when the Advanced Code Editor is opened again.

For information on the **Advanced Code Editor** plugin, see: xref:advcode.adoc[Advanced Code Editor].

=== Spell Checker Pro 3.3.0

The {productname} 6.5 release includes an accompanying release of the **Spell Checker Pro** premium plugin.

**Spell Checker Pro** 3.3.0 includes three additions and one change:

==== New `mceSpellcheckUpdate` command

The new `mceSpellcheckUpdate` command allows users to trigger a check for misspelled words in the editor content, and includes any spelling suggestions for the misspelt words.

This allows users to verify their spelling all at once without the use of the Spellchecker dialog, with any suggestions available from a context menu.

==== New `SpellcheckerUpdated` event

The new `SpellcheckerUpdated` event is triggered each time the editor content is updated to display new misspelt words once suggestions are provided for those misspelt words.

This event is currently supported when using the `mceSpellcheckUpdate` command or when opening the dialog.

NOTE: This event is not currently supported in As-you-type mode.

==== New `getSpellingErrors()` API

The new `getSpellingErrors()` API allows users to retrieve a list of each misspelling in the editor content.

=== Words containing non-Latin characters were not sent in spelling requests.
//#TINY-9654

As of Spell Checker Pro 3.2.1, only languages using a Latin-based alphabet — for example; English, French, and German — had supported dictionaries.

As a consequence, Spell Checker Pro’s client-side only sent strings containing Latin characters in spelling requests to the server, omitting words containing non-Latin characters from languages such as Greek, Arabic, and Korean.

This interfered with some use-cases in which Spell Checker Pro client-side was paired with a custom spellchecking service which supports languages with non-Latin alphabets: words containing non-Latin characters were not sent to the server.

In SpellChecker Pro 3.3.0, the word identification logic for the plugin’s client-side has been changed to the one used by the Word Count plugin. This allows words containing non-Latin characters to be captured and sent in requests to the spelling service.

For information on the **SpellChecker Pro** plugin, see: xref:introduction-to-tiny-spellchecker.adoc[Spell Checker Pro].

=== Advanced Typography 1.1.3

The {productname} 6.5 release includes an accompanying release of the **Advanced Typography** premium plugin.

**Advanced Typography** 1.1.3 includes one fix.

=== Fixed adding unnecessary space after a comma and before a quote in several scenarios.
//#TINY-9510

In previous versions of {productname}, the issue of adding an unnecessary space after a comma and before a quote in several scenarios was caused by an incorrectly written Regular Expression rule in the https://github.com/typograf[Typograf] library used by the Advanced Typography plugin. This led to the appearance of spaces between commas and quotes.

To fix this, {productname} updated the Regular Expression rule in the Typograf library. As a result, spaces between commas and quotes no longer appear.

For information on the **Advanced Typography** plugin, see: xref:advanced-typography.adoc[Advanced Typography].

=== Advanced Templates 1.2.0

The {productname} 6.5 release includes an accompanying release of the **Advanced Templates** premium plugin.

**Advanced Templates** 1.2.0 includes the following fix.

=== A selected item within its parent directory in tree components, did not remain selected after closing the directory
//#TINY-9715

This new release of the **Advanced Templates** plugin corrects this. It now tracks the selected leaf’s active state before and after collapsing or expanding the leaf’s parent directory. This ensures the selection state of a leaf is preserved when the leaf’s parent directory is collapsed or expanded.

This new release of the **Advanced Templates** plugin corrects this. It now tracks the selected leaf’s active state before and after collapsing or expanding the leaf’s parent directory.

For information on the **Advanced Templates** plugin, see: xref:advanced-templates.adoc[Advanced Templates].
**Advanced Templates** 1.2.0 includes three fixes.

=== Expanded category trees collapsed after any element in the tree was renamed in the Templates dialog’s tree component.
//#TINY-9691

In the previous version of {productname}, when users renamed a template or category in the *Insert → template…* dialog, the template list refreshed and expanded categories collapsed.

Although cosmetic, this state loss hid the renamed template or category; a likely cause of user confusion. 

This update addresses this using a new configuration property, `defaultExpandedIds`. The `defaultExpandedIDs` property allows the category tree’s state to be saved before executing the rename operation and then passed back for re-rendering the tree after the re-naming.

With this update, after a template or category is re-named, the template list is re-rendered in the same state as it was prior to the re-naming. Consequently, if an object was in an expanded tree prior to being re-named, it will remain visible as a re-named object when the tree refreshes.

=== A selected tree component template item did not stay highlighted when the Templates dialog re-rendered.
//#TINY-9770

In previous versions of {productname}, a selected tree component template item would lose its highlight when the Advanced Template dialog was re-rendered after the template list updated.

This occured when a user renamed a selected template item in the tree component. As a consequence, the user could not identify the currently selected item in the tree.

In {productname} 6.5, the problem was addressed by utilizing the new `defaultSelectedId` configuration property from the xref:dialog-components.adoc#tree[tree component] API.

As a result, the currently previewed template is now correctly highlighted in the tree component, as expected.

=== The *Insert → Template…* menu item and equivalent toolbar button was not disabled when the selection was inside an element with a `contenteditable="false"` attribute set
//#TINY-9892

In previous versions of {productname}, the *Insert → Template…* menu item, and equivalent toolbar button remained active when the user’s selection or insertion point was inside an element with a `contenteditable="false"` attribute set.

As a consequence, the *Advanced Template* toolbar button and menu item appeared enabled, but clicking on them had no effect.

A fix was implemented in {productname} 6.5. {productname} now checks if the user’s current selection is within an element with a `contenteditable="false"` attribute set. If it is, the *Advanced Template* toolbar button and menu item are disabled, as expected.

For information on the **Advanced Templates** plugin, see: xref:advanced-templates.adoc[Advanced Templates].

=== Merge Tags 1.3.0

The {productname} 6.5 release includes an accompanying release of the **Merge Tags** premium plugin.

**Merge Tags** 1.3.0 includes three fixes:

=== The plugin now correctly manages prefixes and suffixes when they are the same.
//#TINY-9566

In previous versions of **Merge Tags** the plugin mishandled a merge tags’ prefix and suffix when the user placed multiple merge tags within either an inline or block element. This resulted in incorrect management of these prefixes and suffixes during the `setContent` operation.

This mis-management resulted in an unintended repetition of the prefix or suffix occurred, which lead to undesired output.

For example, if the input was: 

[source, html]
----
<div>%Tag1% this is a bug %Tag1%</div>
----

the output, after the `setContent` operation was:

[source, html]
----
%Tag1%%% this is a bug %%%Tag1%
----

As of this **Merge Tags** update, the plugin now splits the array of any matching merge tags that are identified as _odd_ prefixes or suffixes. As a consequence, merge tag prefixes and suffixes that are the same are output as expected.

For information on the **Merge Tags** plugin, see: xref:mergetags.adoc[Merge Tags].

=== Right clicking on a merge tag instance presented different highlighting depending on the host browser.
//#TINY-9848

In previous versions of {productname}, when users right-clicked on a merge tag, the highlighting within the merge tag selection varied, depending on the host browser.

This resulted in an inconsistent end-user experience.

{productname} 6.5 no longer uses a browser’s default highlighting of the merge tag. Instead, {productname} 6.5 introduces {productname}-specific styles. These styles highlight the merge tag consistently across different browsers.

{productname} now presents end-users with uniform merge tag highlighting across all supported browsers.

=== *Insert → Merge tag* menu item, and equivalent toolbar button was not disabled when selection was inside an element with a `contenteditable="false"` attribute set
//#TINY-9893

In previous versions of {productname}, the *Insert → Merge tag* menu item, and equivalent toolbar button remained active when the user’s selection or insertion point was inside an element with a `contenteditable="false"` attribute set.

As a consequence the *Merge tags* toolbar button and menu item appeared enabled, but clicking on them had no effect.

A fix was implemented in {productname} 6.5. {productname} now checks if the user’s current selection is within an element with a `contenteditable="false"` attribute set. If it is, the *Merge tags* toolbar button and menu item are disabled, as expected.

For information on the **Merge Tags** plugin, see: xref:mergetags.adoc[Merge Tags].

=== Format Painter 2.0.2

The {productname} 6.5 release includes an accompanying release of the **Format Painter** Premium plugin.

**Format Painter** 2.0.2 includes one fix:

=== It was possible to modify text elements with the `contenteditable="false"` attribute set using formatpainter
//#TINY-9472

Users could use previous versions of the Format Painter plugin to modify text elements with the `contenteditable="false"` attribute set.

That is, users could, contrary to the attribute setting, make formatting changes to text marked as Read Only using this plugin.

With this update, the Format Painter plugin marks the `contenteditable="false"` attribute setting properly: text elements with this setting are no longer changed if this plugin is applied to them.

For information on the **Format Painter** plugin, see: xref:formatpainter.adoc[Format Painter].


[[accompanying-premium-plugin-end-of-life-announcement]]
== Accompanying Premium Plugin end-of-life announcement

The following premium plugin has been announced as reaching its end-of-life:

=== Real-Time Collaboration

{productname}'s xref:rtc-introduction.adoc[Real-time Collaboration (RTC)] plugin will be deactivated on December 31, 2023, and is no longer available for purchase.


[[accompanying-premium-skins-and-icon-packs-changes]]
== Accompanying Premium Skins and Icon Packs changes

The {productname} 6.5 release includes an accompanying release of the **Premium Skins and Icon Packs**.

=== Premium Skins and Icon Packs

The **Premium Skins and Icon Packs** release includes the following updates:

The **Premium Skins and Icon Packs** were rebuilt to pull in the changes also incorporated into the default {productname} 6.5 skin, Oxide.

For information on using premium skins and icon packs, see: xref:premium-skins-and-icons.adoc[Premium Skins and Icon Packs].


[[improvements]]
== Improvements

{productname} 6.5 also includes the following improvements:

=== Screen readers now announce instructions for using arrow keys to resize the editor when the resize handle is focused
//#TINY-9793

When using voice assistant software in previous versions of {productname}, focusing on the editor resize handle would not announce any instruction.

In {productname} 6.5, instructions for using arrow keys to adjust the editor viewport’s size are now announced upon focusing the editor resize handle, while using voice assistant software.

NOTE: In {productname} 6.5.1, this announcement is only available in English. Additional translations will be added in a future release.

=== If the selection contains multiple table cells, Quickbar toolbars now present at the middle or beginning of the selection, horizontally.
//#TINY-8297

When multiple table cell elements are selected, by default, a blue background indicates their selection.

In previous {productname} versions, however, once a cell selection was made, the Quickbar toolbar presented as pointing at the contents of the last cell in the selection. This gave the (incorrect) visual impression that formatting changes would only affect the contents of cell.

In {productname} 6.5, when multiple table cells are selected, the Quickbar plugin calculates the bounding box of the selected cells. Using this information, the Quickbar now presents with the toolbar’s pointer directed at either the middle or the beginning of the selection, considered horizontally.

This presentation makes it clearer that any Quickbar buttons will be applied to the entire selection.

[[additions]]
== Additions
{productname} 6.5 also includes the following additions:

=== `tabpanel` labels in {productname} dialogs can now word wrap for better readability with long labels.
//#TINY-9947

For {productname} 6.5, improvements were made to the `tabpanel` dialogs: labels on the tabs can now wrap to multiple lines. This improves the readability of the tab labels, particularly when longer labels are displayed.

In particular, the keyboard navigation text in the help dialog is now readable in all languages, without compromising the width of the dialog tab buttons.

=== Support for the `h` hash parameter in vimeo video url in the Media plugin.
//#TINY-9830

In previous versions of {productname}, an issue was identified that prevented unlisted Vimeo videos from been added to the editor when using the media plugin.

The media plugin failed to correctly insert the video into the content due to {productname} ignoring the `h` parameter when parsing the source URL.

In {productname} 6.5, the `h` parameter is now parsed and included in the source URL by {productname}.

As a result, embedding unlisted Vimeo videos into a {productname} editor using the media plugin now works as expected.

[[changes]]
== Changes

{productname} 6.5 also incorporates the following changes:

=== The {productname} *Help* dialog was restored to medium width for better readability.
//#TINY-9947

A change was made in {productname} 6.4 that caused the help dialog to become narrower.

As a result, users experienced difficulty in reading the content, especially in languages other than English.

To address this issue, the width of the help dialog has been restored to its previous size, ensuring better readability for all users.

=== List items in a combo box were not announced by screen readers.
//#TINY-9280

For example, the URL text-entry field in the Link dialog is a combobox. When this element is focused with a screen reader, it is announced as a combobox and pressing the down arrow shows the available list items.

In previous versions of {productname}, however, none of these items were announced by the screen reader as they were selected, making these items effectively invisible to screen reader users.

With this update, listed items in a combobox can be announced by screen readers, as expected.

=== When dragging and dropping image elements within the editor the `dragend` event would sometimes not fire when Firefox was the host browser.
//#TINY-9694

Previously, when dragging and dropping image elements within the editor, the `dragend` event would, in some circumstances, not trigger when the host browser was Mozilla Firefox. 

With this update, a fix for this was implemented. {productname} 6.5 now ensures that the `dragend` event consistently fires when an image is dropped in the editor, even when the host browser is Firefox.

=== The anchor element (`a`) could contain block child elements when the editor schema was set to *HTML 4*.
//#TINY-9805

In previous versions of {productname}, the anchor element — `<a>` — could have block elements added as children when the schema was set to *HTML 4*.

Consequently, applying a heading element (for example, an `<h1>` element) to a link within a table caption would affect the editor view, even though the table caption tag was not included in the serialized content.

To address this issue, an update was made to the editor’s HTML4 schema: block child elements are now not allowed in anchor tags.

As a result, applying block formatting to link content in {productname} 6.5, should no longer have any impact.

=== The `caption`, `address` and `dt` elements could contain block child elements when the editor schema was set to *HTML 4*.
//#TINY-9768

In previous versions of {productname}, the `<caption>`, `<dt>` and `<address>` elements could have block elements added as children when the schema was set to *HTML 4*.

The *HTML 4* schema does not support this and, as a consequence, {productname} documents containing such child elements did not validate against HTML 4-specific parsers and validators.

In {productname} 6.5, the editor’s *HTML 4* schema has been corrected. Block elements are now, correctly, considered invalid inside such elements and are automatically unwrapped out of the elements noted above.


[[bug-fixes]]
== Bug fixes

{productname} 6.5 also includes the following bug fixes:

=== In some circumstances, the selected element would, when it was reused or otherwise reset, not have an initial selected value when it was expected to.
//#TINY-9679

Previously, issues between the host browser and the editor switching between an element’s children, lead to the element presenting an erroneous empty state when displayed.

To resolve this, such elements can no longer be empty unless the user explicitly sets them as such.

In {productname} 6.5, these elements will now have a populated value unless the user specifically chooses an empty selection.

=== Initializing the editor with a pre-inserted table displayed resize handles even when the editor was not focused
//#TINY-9748

Previously, resize handles presented on tables in a newly-initialised editor even though the table did not have focus. This happened because the insertion point is automatically placed in the first valid element (in this case, a table cell) during editor initialization.

In {productname} 6.5, the resize handles have been adjusted to prevent their display when the insertion point is inside a table element without the editor being focused.

=== Enabling or disabling checkboxes did not set the correct classes and attributes
//#TINY-4189

In the previous version of {productname}, the checkbox element’s disabled state was not correctly applied to all elements. As a result, the state was neither properly removed nor added as intended.

This error also left checkboxes potentially presenting as in a state that was not true (for example, presenting as enabled when they were not enabled).

To rectify this issue, the control was adjusted and relocated to ensure that it functions as expected.

With this update, enabling or disabling checkboxes sets the correct classes and attributes and presents the current state correctly to the end-user.

=== Inline alert in the "Search and Replace" dialog persisted when it was not necessary.
//#TINY-9704

Previously, the *Find and Replace* dialog was not updated following a modification to the “Find in selection” option. Consequently, the “not found” alert would persist and not disappear as intended.

To resolve this issue, necessary UI updates were implemented after the change to the “Find in selection” option. As a result, the “not found” alert is now reset every time the “Find in selection” option is altered.

=== Removing an image that failed to upload from an empty paragraph would leave the paragraph without a padding `<br />` tag.
//#TINY-9696

Previously, when an image upload into an otherwise empty paragraph failed, the upload failure resulted in the empty paragraph not having the expected `<br />` tag to serve as padding.

When the upload failure was noted by a {productname} editor instance, and the placeholder material for the expected image was removed by the editor, the expected padding was not set.

The empty paragraph element was, in this circumstance, rendered inaccessible. And it presented to the end-user as the empty paragraph element being removed or improperly formatted.

In {productname} 6.5, when the `images_uploade_handler` gets a `remove: true` callback, the parent element is checked and, if required padding is not present, it is added.

=== In some specific circumstances, if Google Chrome was the host browser, when the insertion point was placed after a table, adding a newline did not generate the expected newline.
//#TINY-9813

Previously, when Google Chrome was the host browser, there were circumstances where adding a newline character after a table did not produce the expected outcome (that is, a new line).

When the insertion point was positioned after a table, it was placed in the `<body>` at offset 1 instead of within any of its children.

As a result, when an element with a `contenteditable= "false"` attribute came after it, it was deemed invalid to insert a newline at that position. Consequently, no newline was added.

As of this release, {productname} now recognises this position as valid, and the expected root blocks are inserted.

=== In some cases, exiting a `blockquote` element could fail when the insertion point was positioned at the end of the `blockquote` element.
//#TINY-9794

There was an issue with exiting a blockquote element when the insertion point was positioned at the end of the element. this issue arose because, when inserting a new block, the check to determine if the block is empty treated nodes containing a zero-width space (ZWSP) as non-empty.

As part of this update, {productname} 6.5 now correctly recognizes elements containing a ZWSP as empty blocks.

As a consequence, exiting blockquote elements now happens even when the insertion point is at the end of the element, as expected.

=== Context toolbars would display the incorrect status for the Advanced List plugin buttons.
//#TINY-9680

In previous versions of {productname}, a presentation issue was caused by a discrepancy between the setup handler for the Advanced List — `advlist` — Quickbar button in the `advlist` Premium plugin and the setup handler for the List — `list` — Open Source plugin.

Consequently, the status of the `advlist` Quickbar button was not updated correctly during setup.

To resolve this, the setup handler for the `advlist` plugin was aligned with the one used in the `list` plugin. The status of the buttons is now accurately rendered, as expected.

=== Inserting two tables consecutively without focus in the editor resulted in the second table being inserted at the wrong position.
//#TINY-3909

In previous versions of {productname}, an issue was identified that resulted in the incorrect execution of the `remove_trailing_br` function by **DomParser**. This resulted in the insertion point focusing on the `<tr>` element instead of the `<td>` element.

As a consequence, when inserting a table with the focus on `<tr>`, the table would be placed in the wrong location.

To fix this, the `remove_trailing_br` function was extracted, with the default behavior now set to execute within the serializer. Although the function remains in the parser, its default setting has been modified to not execute by default, as removing it entirely could cause compatibility issues.

NOTE: The configuration related to this issue will be deprecated in `DomParserSetting` in a future {productname} release.

=== The destination category list would include the template’s own category in the *Move to…* dialog.
//#TINY-9774

When users seek to move a template to another category, a *Move to…* dialog is presented, with a dropdown list of available categories.

In previous versions of {productname}, this list included a redundant category: the current category of the template being moved. If the selected destination category in the *Move to…* dialog matched this original template category, the operation had no effect.

In {productname} 6.5, the destination category list now filters out the category of the template being moved.

Consequently, users no longer see the parent category of the template in the *Move to…* dialog’s category list.

=== Closing a dialog would scroll down the document in Safari on macOS. 
//#TINY-9148

In Safari running on macOS, when a dialog was closed by clicking outside the dialog, a bug caused the browser to select the active element and scroll down.

This caused the browser to scroll the viewport to the bottom of the dialog after the dialog closed.

This scrolling did not occur if the dialog was closed by pressing the dialog close control or by typing the *Esc* key.

To fix this issue, {productname} now forces the active element to blur when Safari is the host browser. By doing so, no element is selected after closing the dialog, preventing the unintended scrolling behavior.

=== Text within anchor tags, <a>, presented with the Times New Roman font-family, ignoring the font family used in the original document.
//#TINY-9812

In previous versions of {productname}, an issue related to the `a:link` selector in the CSS received from Microsoft Word was identified.

When content containing links was pasted from a Microsoft Word file into a {productname} instance running the xref:introduction-to-powerpaste.adoc[PowerPaste] plugin, the pasted-in link text rendered using the Times New Roman font family. And it presented thus no matter the typeface set for this text in the original Microsoft Word document.

To work around this, {productname} 6.5 removes the default CSS styling applied by Microsoft Word during the paste operation.

With this change, link text copied from Microsoft Word using the PowerPaste plugin now uses the font-family matching that used in the source document.

=== Invalid markup in Notification and Dialog close buttons.
//#TINY-9849

In previous versions of {productname}, an issue was identified in the close buttons: invalid markup was present. Specifically, a div element was being used within the buttons. This violates HTML standards and caused problems when running {productname} HTML through markup checkers: the checker, correctly, threw errors.

In {productname} 6.5, the markup was fixed by replacing the div element with a `<span>` element, aligning it with HTML guidelines. As a result, the updated close buttons now pass HTML markup checkers without throwing errors.

=== Context menus and menu items were not constrained within the scrollable container if the parent node was a Shadow root
//#TINY-9743

In previous versions of {productname}, context menus and menu items could overflow beyond the editor’s bounds when the parent node was a Shadow root.

Prior to this update, {productname} only supported the Shadow DOM API if its container node was a child of the Shadow root. 

To address this overflowing menu issue, {productname} 6.5 added support for the Shadow Dom API when the editor’s container node is a parent of the Shadow host node.

Context menus and menu items are now constrained within the scrollable container if the editor’s root node is a parent of the Shadow host node.


[[security-fixes]]
== Security fixes

{productname} 6.5 includes a fix for the following security issue:


[[known-issues]]
== Known issues

This section describes issues that users of {productname} 6.5 may encounter and possible workarounds for these issues.

There are several known issues in {productname} 6.5.

=== Untranslated instructions for editor resize handle when using screen readers

In {productname} 6.5, instructions for using the editor resize handle were introduced, however these instructions are only provided in English.

Translations for these instructions will be added in a future enterprise release.

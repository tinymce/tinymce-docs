== Accompanying Premium Plugin changes

The following premium plugin updates were released alongside {productname} 6.5.


=== Spell Checker Pro 3.3.0

The {productname} 6.5 release includes an accompanying release of the **Spell Checker Pro** premium plugin.

Spell Checker Pro 3.3.0 adds one change:

=== Words containing non-Latin characters were not sent in spelling requests.
//#TINY-9654

As of Spell Checker Pro 3.2.1, only languages using a Latin-based alphabet, including English, French, German, etc., had supported dictionaries. As a result, Spell Checker Pro's client side only sent words it “understands” in spelling requests to the server, omitting words containing non-Latin characters from languages like Greek, Arabic, and Korean. Specifically, the word identification logic used the regular expression `/[\w'\\-\u00AD\u0100-\u017F\u00C0-\u00FF\uFEFF\u2018\u2019]/` to capture characters including the extended Latin alphabet. This interfered with the usages of some customers pairing the Spell Checker Pro client side with a custom spellchecking service with support for languages with non-Latin alphabets, as words containing non-Latin characters would not be sent to the server.

In {productname} 6.5, the word identification logic for Spell Checker Pro's client side has now been changed to the one used by the Word Count plugin. This allows words containing non-Latin characters to be captured and sent in requests to the spelling service.

[[improvement]]
== Improvement

{productname} 6.6 also includes the following improvement:

=== When defining a modal or inline dialog, if the `buttons` property is `undefined` or an empty array, the footer will now no longer be rendered
//#TINY-9996

// CCFR here.


[[additions]]
== Additions

{productname} 6.6 also includes the following additions:

=== Added new `bottom` to inline dialog type
//#TINY-9888

This new inline dialog option allows the inline dialog to be positioned at the bottom of the editor

// more CCFR here.

=== Added new `persistent` option to `WindowParams`.
//#TINY-9991

This new option allows the inline dialog to be persistent, meaning that it will not be closed when the user clicks outside of the dialog

// more CCFR here.

=== - New `ai`, `ai-prompt` and `send` icons.
//#TINY-9942

// CCFR here.

// link out to ai premium plugin page here?

=== New `streamContent` property for the `iframe` dialog component which controls dialog `setData()` behavior. 
//#TINY-10032

With the property set to `true`, frame content will update with `document.write()` to avoid reloading the frame, and end scroll positions will be maintained as new content streams in.

// more CCFR here.


[[bug-fix]]
== Bug fix

{productname} 6.6 also includes the following bug fix:

=== Fixed an issue that prevented setting the inline dialog `size` to _medium_ or _normal_.
//#TINY-10015

Previously, although the inline dialog specification included a `size` option, the function was not implemented. As a consequence, no matter what value `size` was set to, an inline dialog’s size defaulted to `normal`.

For this update the missing functionality, which applies the necessary CSS when a `size` value is set for an inline dialog, was added.

Setting an inline dialog to any of the supported sizes — 

[source,js]
----
size: 'normal', // or
size: 'medium', // or
size: 'large',
----

— now changes the dialog’s width, as expected.

[[improvement]]
== Improvement

{productname} 6.6.1 also includes the following improvement:

=== When Safari is the host browser, content updates for iframe dialog components with `streamContent: true` set are now throttled to 500ms intervals
//#TINY-10097

When `iframe` dialog components have xref:dialog-configuration.adoc#dialog_streamContent[`streamContent: true`] set, content is updated using the `document.write()` method rather than by setting the `srcdoc` attribute to prevent the `iframe` from reloading.

This setting stops the iframe from flickering as it updates its contents when the host browser is Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.

The flickering still occurred when the host browser was Apple Safari, however.

In {productname} 6.6.1, content updates for `iframe` dialog components with `streamContent: true` set are throttled to 500ms intervals when Safari is the host browser. This significantly reduces the apparent flickering.

NOTE: This throttling is specific to Safari. It is not applied when any browser other than Safari is the host browser.

== Addition

{productname} 6.6.1 also includes the following addition:

=== New `pad_empty_with_br` option that can be set to `true` to pad empty block elements with `<br>` tag instead of nbsp character
//#TINY-9861

[[change]]
== Change

{productname} 6.6.1 also includes the following change:

=== API comments/documentation corrected: a typo correction and run-on sentences fixed.
//#TINY-10073


[[bug-fixes]]
== Bug fixes

{productname} 6.6.1 also includes the following bug fixes:

=== On Safari and Firefox browsers, scroll positions were not always maintained when updating the content of a `streamContent: true` iframe dialog component
//#TINY-10078 #TINY-10109

// CCFR here.

=== Scrolling behavior was inconsistent when updating a `streamContent: true` iframe dialog component with content lacking an HTML document type declaration.
//#TINY-10110

// CCFR here.

//#TINY-10070

// TINY-9764

// TINY-9744

=== If loading content CSS takes more than 500ms, the editor will be set to an *in progress* state until the CSS is ready
// TINY-10008



[[bug-fixes]]
== Bug fixes

=== Applying an ordered or unordered list to a selected checklist incorrectly turned the list into paragraphs
// TINY-9975

=== Returning an empty string in a custom context menu update function resulted in a small white line appearing on right-click and the browser-native context menu would not present
// TINY-9842

=== For sufficiently long URLs and sufficiently wide windows, URL autocompletion hid middle portions of the URL from view
// TINY-10017

=== Numeric input in toolbar items did not disable when a switching from edit to read-only mode
// TINY-10129

=== The Quick Toolbars plugin showed text alignment buttons on pagebreaks
// TINY-10054

=== Creating lists in empty blocks sometimes, and incorrectly, converted adjacent block elements into list items
// TINY-10136

=== Creating a list from multiple `<div>` elements only created a partial list
// TINY-9872

=== Tab navigation incorrectly stopped around `iframe` dialog components
// TINY-9815

=== It was possible to delete the sole empty block immediately before a `<details>` element if it was nested within another `<details>` element
// TINY-9965
In previous versions of the xref:accordion.adoc[Accordion Plugin], when inserting an accordion component inside the body of another accordion, it was possible to delete the summary block element of the nested accordion.

{productname} 6.7 introduced a fix that now blocks the `delete` and `backspace` keys when pressed within a empty block before an nested accordion.

As a result, using `delete` and `backspace` keys no longer allow the user to delete into the summary element of the accordion, and the caret remains in the empty block before the accordion.

For information on the **Accordion** plugin see xref:accordion.adoc[Accordion]

=== Deleting `<li>` elements that only contained `<br>` tags sometimes caused a crash
// TINY-6888

=== It was possible to remove the `<summary>` element from a `<details>` element by dragging and dropping
// TINY-9960

=== It was possible to break `<summary>` elements if content containing block elements was dragged-and-dropped inside them
// TINY-9960

=== Contents were not removed from the drag start source if dragging and dropping internally into a transparent block element
// TINY-9960

=== Using the Media plugin unexpectedly changed `<script>` tags in the editor body to `<image>` tags
// TINY-10007

=== In some circumstances, pressing the **Enter** key scrolled the entire page
// TINY-9828

=== The border styles of a table were incorrectly split into a longhand form after table dialog updates
// TINY-9843

=== Links in **Help → Help → Plugins** and **Help → Help → Version** were not navigable by keyboard
// TINY-10071

=== Fixed the inability to insert content next to the `<details>` element when it is the first or last content element. Pressing the **Up** or **Down** arrow key now inserts a block element before or after the `<details>` element
// TINY-9827

=== An empty element with a `contenteditable="true"` attribute within a noneditable root was deleted when the Backspace key was pressed
// TINY-10011

=== The `color_cols` option was not respected when set to the value 5 with a custom `color_map` specified
// TINY-10126
Previously, when `color_cols: 5` was set, the assigned value was not used.

Instead, when `color_cols` was set to the default number of columns displayed by a {productname} color selection grid (ie 5), the default method for calculating the number of displayed columns is used.

For {productname} 6.7, the logic for calculating the default `color_cols` values was re-written. As of this release, {productname} now uses either the `color_cols` option, with its default calculated on the base color map, or the value calculated by custom color maps.

This ensures a set `color_cols` value is always used, even when that value matches the default value.

=== In Safari on macOS, deleting backwards within a `<summary>` element removed the entire `<details>` element if it had no other content
// TINY-10123
Previously, when Safari was the host browser, and

* the insertion point was inside the `<summary>` element of an Accordion component; and
* there was no other content within the parent `<details>` element;

pressing Backspace deleted the entire `<details>` element rather than just the character immediately before the insertion point.

{productname} 6.7 addresses this. With this release, the Backspace key functions as expected when Safari is the host browser: it deletes only the character immediately before when the insertion point is inside a `<summary>` element, as expected.

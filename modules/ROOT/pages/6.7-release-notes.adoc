== Accompanying Premium plugin changes

The following premium plugin updates were released alongside {productname} 6.7.0.


=== Accessibility Checker 3.2.1

[[improvements]]
== Improvments

=== Adding a newline after a table would, in some specific cases, not work
// TINY-9863

=== Menus now have a slight margin at the top and bottom to more clearly separate them from the frame edge
// TINY-9978

=== Updated **More** toolbar button tooltip text from *More...* to *Reveal or hide additional toolbar items*
// TINY-9629

=== Where multiple case sensitive variants of a translation key are provided, they will now all be preserved in the translation object instead of just the lowercase variant
// TINY-10115

=== Improved screen reader announcements of the column and row selection in the grid presented by the **Table** menu and toolbar item
// TINY-10140

=== Improved the keyboard focus visibility for links inside dialogs
// TINY-10124



[[additions]]
== Additions

=== New `help_accessibility` option displays the keyboard shortcut to open the in-application help in the status bar
// TINY-9379

=== Added new `InsertNewBlockBefore` and `InsertNewBlockAfter` commands which insert an empty block before or after the block containing the current selection
// TINY-10022
{productname} 6.7 includes two new commands: `InsertNewBlockBefore` and `InsertNewBlockAfter`.

These commands address scenarios where navigation encounters spatial constraints; most specifically when the constraint is at a {productname} document’s edges.

For example, if a user inserts a `<details>` element (as part of an **Accordion component**) at the beginning of a {productname} document, the `InsertNewBlockBefore` command now provides a way to set the insertion point above this element. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Blocks added by either command are placed at the root level of the {productname} document, immediately before or after the top parent block encompassing the current selection.
====

[[changes]]
== Changes

=== Change `UndoLevelType` from `enum` to union type so that it is easier to use
// TINY-9764

=== The pattern replacement removed spaces if they were contained within a tag that only contained a space and the text to replace
// TINY-9744

=== If loading content CSS takes more than 500ms, the editor will be set to an *in progress* state until the CSS is ready
// TINY-10008



[[bug-fixes]]
== Bug fixes

=== Applying an ordered or unordered list to a selected checklist incorrectly turned the list into paragraphs
// TINY-9975

=== Returning an empty string in a custom context menu update function resulted in a small white line appearing on right-click and the browser-native context menu would not present
// TINY-9842

=== For sufficiently long URLs and sufficiently wide windows, URL autocompletion hid middle portions of the URL from view
// TINY-10017

=== Numeric input in toolbar items did not disable when a switching from edit to read-only mode
// TINY-10129

=== The Quick Toolbars plugin showed text alignment buttons on pagebreaks
// TINY-10054

=== Creating lists in empty blocks sometimes, and incorrectly, converted adjacent block elements into list items
// TINY-10136

=== Creating a list from multiple `<div>` elements only created a partial list
// TINY-9872

=== Tab navigation incorrectly stopped around `iframe` dialog components
// TINY-9815

=== It was possible to delete the sole empty block immediately before a `<details>` element if it was nested within another `<details>` element
// TINY-9965
In previous versions of the xref:accordion.adoc[Accordion Plugin], when inserting an accordion component inside the body of another accordion, it was possible to delete the summary block element of the nested accordion.

{productname} 6.7 addresses this by blocking *Delete* and *Backspace* key presses when the insertion point is within an empty block before a nested Accordion component.

As a result, using the *Delete* or *Backspace*` keys no longer allows a user to delete into the summary element of an Accordion component, and the insertion point remains in the empty block before the Accordion.

For more information on the **Accordion** plugin see xref:accordion.adoc[Accordion].

=== Deleting `<li>` elements that only contained `<br>` tags sometimes caused a crash
// TINY-6888
In previous  {productname} versions, "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'nextSibling' of null" were thrown in some specific use cases. For example, after the removal of any `<li>` element.

Previously, `<li>` elements used the same caret position as the parent of the new caret container. After removal of the `<li>` element, however, the editor tred to use `ToggleList.mergeWithAdjacentLists` which is used on the `otherLi.parentNode`. This triggered the TypeError, as the editor had already removed the other `otherLi` element.

{productname} 6.7 addresses this by using, for caret position, the `otherLi.parentNode` reference stored in a `const` before the removal.

=== It was possible to remove the `<summary>` element from a `<details>` element by dragging and dropping
// TINY-9960

=== It was possible to break `<summary>` elements if content containing block elements was dragged-and-dropped inside them
// TINY-9960

=== Contents were not removed from the drag start source if dragging and dropping internally into a transparent block element
// TINY-9960

=== Using the Media plugin unexpectedly changed `<script>` tags in the editor body to `<image>` tags
// TINY-10007

=== In some circumstances, pressing the **Enter** key scrolled the entire page
// TINY-9828
{productname} 6.4.2 addressed an issue in which xref:6.4.2-release-notes.adoc#_selection_was_not_correctly_scrolled_horizontally_into_view_when_using_the_selection.scrollIntoView_API[a selection was not correctly scrolled horizontally into view].

{productname} 6.7 includes changes to the previously applied logic to address a further issue, in which scrolling did not reach the correct position in some circumstances.

The fix applied in {productname} 6.4.2 altered the `scrollToMarker` function, affecting not only editor content, but also the editor container itself. This, unintentionally, caused an *Enter* key-press to trigger scrolling of both the content and the container.

{productname} 6.7 makes two changes to address this. It reverts the logic applied in {productname} 6.4.2. And it adjusts the scroll left calculation.

These changes correct both issues. Pressing the *Enter* key no longer triggers scrolling and the selection is (still) correctly scrolled into horizontal view.

=== The border styles of a table were incorrectly split into a longhand form after table dialog updates
// TINY-9843

=== Links in **Help → Help → Plugins** and **Help → Help → Version** were not navigable by keyboard
// TINY-10071
The Help dialog built-in to {productname} includes four tabs:
* *Handy Shortcuts*;
* *Keyboard Navigation*;
* *Plugins*; and
* *Version*.

Previously, keyboard navigation was supported across these four tabs, and into each tab’s contents. (When a tab’s contents have focus, the content can be scrolled through using Arrow keys.)

However, keyboard-based navigation of links in the focussed content was not supported.

{productname} 6.7 corrects this. The `data-alloy-tabstop="true"` attribute, which was previously not applied to these links, has been added.

Users of {productname} 6.7 can navigate to and activate links in Help dialog contents entirely with keyboard navigation.

[NOTE]
====
As of this release, only the *Plugins*, and *Version* tabs include links.

Also, there is no visual feedback when a given tab’s contents pane takes focus.

Consequently, the UX is such that it appears to take two presses of the *Tab* key to go from a tab label having the focus and the first link within a tab’s content pane having focus.

Likewise, going from the first link within a tab’s content pane having focus to a tab label having focus appears to take two presses of the *Shift-Tab* keyboard chord.
====

=== Fixed the inability to insert content next to the `<details>` element when it is the first or last content element. Pressing the **Up** or **Down** arrow key now inserts a block element before or after the `<details>` element
// TINY-9827
Previously, when a `<details>` element, such as is automatically part of an xref:accordion.adoc[Accordion] component, was either the first or last element within a {productname} editor instance, users were unable to move the insertion point above or below the element. This prevented them from adding new content to the editor instance.

In {productname} 6.7, the `InsertNewBlockBefore` and `InsertNewBlockAfter` commands have been associated with the *Up Arrow* and *Down Arrow* keys, activating when the insertion point is in the relevant position.

As a result, when the insertion point is in the relevant position and the user presses either of the *Up Arrow* or *Down Arrow* keys, the insertion point now moves either above or below the `<details>` element when it is at either the beginning or end of the current editor’s content.

=== An empty element with a `contenteditable="true"` attribute within a noneditable root was deleted when the Backspace key was pressed
// TINY-10011
Previously, when an empty element with a `contenteditable="true"` attribute was set within a read-only root (ie a root with a `contenteditable="false"` attribute), the empty element was deleted when the *Backspace* key was pressed.

When the Backspace key was pressed in this circumstance, the {productname} editor removed elements that contained no content.

In doing so the `dom.isEmpty(body)` call returned a value, `true`, even if the called `body` included an element that was empty but had a `contenteditable="true"` attribute set.

As of {productname} 6.7, elements with a `contenteditable="true"` attribute set are no longer treated as empty and the `dom.isEmpty(body)` call no longer returns the value `true` with regards such elements.

As a consequence, these elements are no longer deleted when they are immediately before the insertion point and the Backspace key is pressed.

=== The `color_cols` option was not respected when set to the value 5 with a custom `color_map` specified
// TINY-10126
Previously, when `color_cols: 5` was set, the assigned value was not used.

Instead, when `color_cols` was set to the default number of columns displayed by a {productname} color selection grid (ie 5), the default method for calculating the number of displayed columns is used.

For {productname} 6.7, the logic for calculating the default `color_cols` values was re-written. As of this release, {productname} now uses either the `color_cols` option, with its default calculated on the base color map, or the value calculated by custom color maps.

This ensures a set `color_cols` value is always used, even when that value matches the default value.

=== In Safari on macOS, deleting backwards within a `<summary>` element removed the entire `<details>` element if it had no other content
// TINY-10123
Previously, when Safari was the host browser, and

* the insertion point was inside the `<summary>` element of an Accordion component; and
* there was no other content within the parent `<details>` element;

pressing Backspace deleted the entire `<details>` element rather than just the character immediately before the insertion point.

{productname} 6.7 addresses this. With this release, the Backspace key functions as expected when Safari is the host browser: it deletes only the character immediately before when the insertion point is inside a `<summary>` element, as expected.

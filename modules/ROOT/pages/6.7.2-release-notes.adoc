[[bug-fixes]]
== Bug fixes

{productname} 6.7.2 also includes the following bug fixes:

=== Applying heading formatting to the content of the `summary` element extended its application to the content of the parent `details` element.
// TINY-10154

In previous versions of {productname}, the accordion summary was not functioning as expected.

As a consequence, a structural inconsistency was identified in the editor schema, where heading elements were erroneously considered **invalid** children of a `<summary>` node and any attempts to apply heading formatting to content within the `<summary>` proved unsuccessful.

{productname} 6.7.2 addresses this issue, now, the editor schema permits heading elements as **valid** children of the summary element.

As a result, the `<summary>` element now accommodates phrasing content or a single heading element as expected.

=== The function `getModifierState` did not work on events passed through the editor as expected.
// TINY-10263

// CCFR


=== List items containing a nested list between two text caused some list operations to fail.
// TINY-10268

// CCFR


=== css loading in `toolbardrawertoggletest` flickering.
// TINY-10249

// CCFR


=== Toggling a list that contained a list item element — `<li>` — which, in turn, contained another list item element as its first child, removed other content within the first list item element.
// TINY-10213

// CCFR


=== If multiple inline formatting options were set at the insertion point, turning any one of these options off turned all the set options off.

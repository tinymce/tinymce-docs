[[bug-fixes]]
== Bug fixes

{productname} 6.7.2 also includes the following bug fixes:

=== Applying heading formatting to the content of the `summary` element extended its application to the content of the parent `details` element.
// TINY-10154

// CCFR

=== The function `getModifierState` did not work on events passed through the editor as expected.
// TINY-10263
The exception error "Uncaught TypeError: Illegal invocation" was displayed in the console, when an integrator called the 'getModifierState' function on a **keydown** event object.


As a consequence, any attempts to invoke this function resulted in the TypeError being displayed in the console.

{productname} 6.7.2 addresses this, now, when a integrator uses the `getModifierState` on the event object a keydown event no longer triggers an error.

As a result, the TypeError is no longer displayed when the editor calls the 'getModifierState' function on an event during a **keydown** action.

=== List items containing a nested list between two text caused some list operations to fail.
// TINY-10268

// CCFR


=== css loading in `toolbardrawertoggletest` flickering.
// TINY-10249

// CCFR


=== Toggling a list that contained a list item element — `<li>` — which, in turn, contained another list item element as its first child, removed other content within the first list item element.
// TINY-10213

// CCFR


=== If multiple inline formatting options were set at the insertion point, turning any one of these options off turned all the set options off.
//TINY-10132

[[bug-fixes]]
== Bug fixes

{productname} 6.7.2 also includes the following bug fixes:

=== Applying heading formatting to the content of the `summary` element extended its application to the content of the parent `details` element.
// TINY-10154

// CCFR

=== The function `getModifierState` did not work on events passed through the editor as expected.
// TINY-10263

// CCFR


=== Indenting or outdenting a list item that contained non list item siblings after it would result in those siblings being removed.
// TINY-10268
Previously, when the editor encounter's a list inside an `<li>` element, the editor would only account for scenarios where the list is either the first or last element within the `<li>`. In such cases, {productname} would treat the content contained within the `<li>` as plain HTML, disregarding any nested lists.

Consequently, when dealing with a structure like the following:

[source,html]
----
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A</p>
    <ul>
      <li>L1</li>
      <li>L2</li>
    </ul>
    <p>B</p>
  </li>
</ul>
----

the editor would encounter problems when attempting to apply list-related actions, such as indentation, to the inner list.

{productname} 6.7.2 addresses this issue, now, when an `<li>` contains both non-list elements at its beginning and end, and also contains a nested list, the editor now will consider actions on the nested list independently, instead of treating the entire content as a single block.

As a result, the actions of indenting and unindenting a nested list now work as expected.

=== css loading in `toolbardrawertoggletest` flickering.
// TINY-10249

// CCFR


=== Toggling a list that contained a list item element — `<li>` — which, in turn, contained another list item element as its first child, removed other content within the first list item element.
// TINY-10213

// CCFR


=== If multiple inline formatting options were set at the insertion point, turning any one of these options off turned all the set options off.
//TINY-10132

[[bug-fixes]]
== Bug fixes

{productname} 6.7.2 also includes the following bug fixes:

=== Applying heading formatting to the content of the `summary` element extended its application to the content of the parent `details` element.
// TINY-10154

// CCFR

=== The function `getModifierState` did not work on events passed through the editor as expected.
// TINY-10263

// CCFR


=== List items containing a nested list between two text caused some list operations to fail.
// TINY-10268

// CCFR


=== css loading in `toolbardrawertoggletest` flickering.
// TINY-10249

// CCFR


=== Toggling a list that contained a list item element — `<li>` — which, in turn, contained another list item element as its first child, removed other content within the first list item element.
// TINY-10213
When a user attempted to indent or outdent a list element inside a nested list, the list was converted into a model which resulted in it being recreated from that model.

As a consequence of this, the model would not handle a list and a not-list items inside a `<li>` element, which resulted in content deletion of the not-list item inside the `<li>` structures like:

[source, html]
----
<li>
  [some_list]
  [some_other_element]
</li>
----

In addition, when the editor would try to manage comments at the `<li>` element level, a console error would be thrown resulting in all other elements being ignored.

{productname} 6.7.2 addresses this issue, now, our model correctly manages comments and other elements when they are preceded from a list, and the error is no longer present.

=== If multiple inline formatting options were set at the insertion point, turning any one of these options off turned all the set options off.

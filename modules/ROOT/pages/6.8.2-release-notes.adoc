* xref:accompanying-premium-plugin-changes[Accompanying Premium plugin changes]
* xref:bug-fixes[Bug fixes]


[[accompanying-premium-plugin-changes]]
== Accompanying Premium plugin changes

The following premium plugin updates were released alongside {productname} 6.8.2.

=== PowerPaste 6.2.4

The {productname} 6.8.2 release includes an accompanying release of the **PowerPaste** premium plugin.

**PowerPaste** 6.2.4 includes the following fix.

==== `white-space-collapse` CSS property was not correctly supported when pasting from Google Docs.
// #TINY-9967
From major version 114, Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge added support for the CSS4 shorthand `white-space` property. The shorthand `white-space` property would be expanded into the `white-space-collapse` and `text-wrap` properties. This resulted in PowerPaste not being able to remove the `white-space-collapse` and `text-wrap` properties from the emitted content even after `white-space: pre` is removed. This issue was particularly noticeable when copying content from Google Docs.

As of {productname} 6.8.2, PowerPaste now supports working with the shorthand `white-space` property by removing the expanded `white-space-collapse` and `text-wrap` properties when present from Google Docs content.

For information on the **PowerPaste** plugin, see: xref:introduction-to-powerpaste.adoc[PowerPaste].


[[bug-fixes]]
== Bug fixes

{productname} 6.8.2 also includes the following bug fix<es>:

=== Bespoke select toolbar buttons including `fontfamily`, `fontsize`, `blocks`, and `styles` incorrectly used plural words in their accessible names.
// #TINY-10426

// CCFR here.

=== The `align` bespoke select toolbar button had an accessible name that was misleading and grammatically incorrect in certain cases.
// #TINY-10435

// CCFR here.

=== Accessible names of bespoke select toolbar buttons including `align`, `fontfamily`, `fontsize`, `blocks`, and `styles` were incorrectly translated.
// #TINY-10426 #TINY-10435

// CCFR here.

=== Clicking inside table cells with heavily nested content could cause the browser to hang.
// #TINY-10380
Previously when clicking below content that is heavily nested inside a block such as a table cell, would cause the browser to hang.

{productname} 6.8.2 addresses this, by optimizing the code responsible for the hang while updating the algorithm.

As a result, the browser no longer hangs, when clicking inside table cells with heavily nested content.

=== Toggling a list that contains an LI element having another list as its first child would remove the remaining content within that LI element.
// #TINY-10414
In a previous xref:6.7.2-release-notes.adoc#toggling-a-list-that-contained-a-list-item-element-li-which-in-turn-contained-another-list-item-element-as-its-first-child-removed-other-content-within-the-first-list-item-element[fix] _(toggling-a-list-that-contained-a-list-item-element-li-which-in-turn-contained-another-list-item-element-as-its-first-child-removed-other-content-within-the-first-list-item-element)_ for lists, some element structures would not recreate the `<li>` tags when a list element was toggled using the `bullist` button in the toolbar.

.Example structure 
[source, html]
----
<li>
  <ul>...</ul>
  <something-else/>
</li>
----

As a consequence, any tags nested within the `li` would be deleted from the {productname} document, resulting in content loss for the user.

{productname} 6.8.2 addresses this by improving the representation of the list to manage this case.

As a result, now, when toggling `<li>` elements using the `bullist` button, content within a list is now correctly recreated the content is retained as expected.

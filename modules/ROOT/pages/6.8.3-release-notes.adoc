[[accompanying-premium-plugin-changes]]
== Accompanying Premium plugin changes

The following premium plugin updates were released alongside {productname} 6.8.3.

=== PowerPaste 6.2.5

The {productname} 6.8.3 release includes an accompanying release of the **PowerPaste** premium plugin.

**PowerPaste** 6.2.5 includes the following fix.

==== PowerPaste would sometimes consider a shape or a picture to be an equation when it is not.
//#TINY-10449

In previous versions of **PowerPaste**, users encountered an issue while copying/pasting content from a Microsoft Word document when **PowerPaste** Plugin was enabled in the editors configuration.

As a consequence, if the copied content contained images and equations, the images would not appear in the expected locations on paste.

**PowerPaste** 6.2.5 addresses this issue, by enhancing the image and equation detection logic.

As a result, images now appear in their correct locations as expected.

[NOTE]
The current version of **PowerPaste** does not currently support equations within {productname}.

For information on the **PowerPaste** plugin, see: xref:introduction-to-powerpaste.adoc[PowerPaste].


[[bug-fixes]]
== Bug fixes

{productname} 6.8.3 also includes the following bug fixes:

=== `ShadowDOM` skin was not loaded properly when used with js bundling feature.
//#TINY-10451

When using the js bundling feature with the `ShadowDom` skin, the editor would not load the skin properly.

As a consequence, any editor bundled with this specific setup would result in the editor loading without displaying the toolbar.

{productname} 6.8.3 addresses this issue, now, during the loading process the `ShadowDOM` skin is correctly used when using the js bundling feature.

As a result, the editor loads properly and the toolbar appears as expected.

=== The floating toolbar would not be fully visible when the editor was placed inside a scrollable container.
//#TINY-10335

Previously, when the editor was configured to be set within a scrollable container, and the `ui_mode: 'split'` is set, the floating toolbar was obscured when the user switched to fullscreen.

As a consequence, the floating toolbar UI was not completely visible when switching to fullscreen.

{productname} 6.8.3 addresses this, now, when the container containing the editor UI elements are set to a `fixed` css position when the editor is switched to fullscreen.

As a result, the toolbar is now no longer obscured when switching to fullscreen.

== Enhancements

The following enhancements were made for the {productname} 6.0 release.

=== `+tabindex+` improvement

In iframe (classic editor) mode, {productname} now copies the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/tabindex[`+tabindex+` attribute] from the target element to the editor's iframe. This accessibility improvement allows integrators to rely on the browser behavior for specifying tab order, instead of specially configuring {productname}. It also replaces the Tabfocus plugin.

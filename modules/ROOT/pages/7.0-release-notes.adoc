[[bug-fixes]]
== Bug fixes

{productname} <x.y[.z]> also includes the following bug fix<es>:

=== <TINY-vwxyz 1 changelog entry>
//#TINY-vwxyz1

=== Fixed incorrect object processor for `event_root` option.
// #TINY-10433

Previously in {productname}, the `inline` mode `event_root` option incorrectly used an `object` processor.

This caused the option to be unregistered when passing a `string` value, resulting in the option being unusable.

{productname} 7.0 addresses this, now, the `event_root` option uses the correctly uses the `string` processor.

As the result, the `event_root` option can now be correctly used to specify a CSS selector for an element.

=== Clicking to the left or right of a non-editable `div` in Firefox would show two cursors.
// #TINY-10314

Previously in Firefox, when the `FakeCaret` was rendered, in some cases the real caret was incorrectly rendered too.

As a consequence, the `FakeCaret` was visible at the same time as the real caret which should have been `hidden`.

{productname} 7.0 addresses this issue, now, the container containing the real caret, when we render the `FakeCaret`, is styled with `'caret-color': 'transparent'`.

As a result, the real caret is now hidden when {productname} renders the `FakeCaret`.

=== Directly right clicking on a `<ol>`/ `<li>` in FireFox didn't enable the button `List Properties...` in the context menu
// #TINY-10490

In previous versions of {productname}, two issues where identified that affected `list properties` for `<ol><li>` tags:

. in old versions of Firefox (prior to version 121), the caret was not moved to the target position when using the right click, and;

. as {productname} creates a bookmark when there is no selection for Firefox, when a user opened a context menu the editor would jump back to the newly created bookmark.

As a consequence, since the selection is still on the first element, the `List Properties...` context menu item was `disabled`.

{productname} 7.0 addresses this issue, now when the user opens a context menu, {productname} creates a new bookmark to avoid the jump back.

As a result, the selection is in the correct place and the `List Properties...` context menu item is `enabled`.


=== The toolbar width was miscalculated for the inline editor positioned inside a scrollable container.
// #TINY-10581

Previously in {productname}, the inline editor's toolbar width was calculated using the `outerContainer` width.

Consequently, the toolbar was given a width of `0`, resulting in the toolbar collapsing to the minimum width.

{productname} 7.0 addresses this issue, now, a check has been introduced to prevent the adjustment of the toolbar's width if the calculated value is `0`.

As a result, the inline editor now correctly displays the toolbar's width when positioned inside a scrollable container.

=== Heading formatting would be partially applied to the content within the `summary` element when the caret was positioned between words.
// #TINY-10312

With the release of {productname} 6.8, applying heading formatting to the content within the `<summary>` element was introduced. However, an issue was identified: if the caret was positioned between words, the editor's selection expand range functionality would not expand the selection to include the entire content within the `<summary>` element.

As a consequence, the heading formatting was partially applied to some of the content within the `<summary>` element.

{productname} 7.0 addresses this issue, now, updates were made to the editor's selection expand range functionality.

As a result, the heading format is applied to the entire content within the `<summary>` element, regardless of the carets location.

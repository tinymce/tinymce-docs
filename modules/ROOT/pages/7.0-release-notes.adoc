=== Heading formatting would be partially applied to the content within the `summary` element when the caret was positioned between words.
// #TINY-10312

With the release of {productname} 6.8, applying heading formatting to the content within the `<summary>` element was introduced. However, an issue was identified: 

- if the caret was positioned between words, and;
- before or after a **`+&nbsp;+`** space character.

As a consequence, the heading formatting was partially applied to some of the content within the `<summary>` element.

{productname} 7.0 addresses this issue, now, updates were made to the editor's selection expand range functionality.

As a result, the heading format is applied to the entire content within the `<summary>` element, regardless of the carets location.

=== Clicking to the left or right of a non-editable `div` in Firefox would show two cursors.
// #TINY-10314

Previously in Firefox, when the `FakeCaret` was rendered, in some cases the real caret was incorrectly rendered too

As a consequence, the `FakeCaret` was visible at the same time as the real caret which should have been `hidden`.

{productname} 7.0 addresses this issue, now, the container containing the real caret, when we render the `FakeCaret`, is styled with `'caret-color': 'transparent'`.

As a result, the real caret is now hidden when {productname} renders the `FakeCaret`.

[[bug-fixes]]
== Bug fixes

{productname} <x.y[.z]> also includes the following bug fix<es>:

=== <TINY-vwxyz 1 changelog entry>
//#TINY-vwxyz1

=== Fixed incorrect object processor for `event_root` option.
// #TINY-10433

Previously in {productname}, the `inline` mode `event_root` option incorrectly used an `object` processor.

This caused the option to be unregistered when passing a `string` value, resulting in the option being unusable.

{productname} 7.0 addresses this, now, the `event_root` option uses the correctly uses the `string` processor.

As the result, the `event_root` option can now be correctly used to specify a CSS selector for an element.

// CCFR here.

=== Directly right clicking on a `<ol>`/ `<li>` in FireFox didn't enable the button `List Properties...` in the context menu
// #TINY-10490

In previous versions of {productname}, two issues where identified that affected `list properties` for `<ol><li>` tags:

. in old versions of Firefox (prior to version 121), the caret was not moved to the target position when using the right click, and;

. as {productname} creates a bookmark when there is no selection for Firefox, when a user opened a context menu the editor would jump back to the newly created bookmark.

As a consequence, since the selection is still on the first element, the `List Properties...` context menu item was `disabled`.

{productname} 7.0 addresses this issue, now when the user opens a context menu, {productname} creates a new bookmark to avoid the jump back.

As a result, the selection is in the correct place and the `List Properties...` context menu item is `enabled`.

=== `TableOperations.opEraseRows` did not calculate the correct row index for colgroup tables.
// #TINY-6309

Previously, when deleting a row or column in a table within {productname}, the caret or cursor position would relocate to the first cell of the table.

As a consequence, users expected it to be repositioned much closer, such as to an adjacent cell in the previous row or column.

In {productname} 7.0, this issue is addressed, now, when a user deletes a row or column in a table, the caret/cursor position is now relocated to the adjacent cell in the previous row or column.

== Bug fixes

{productname} <x.y[.z]> also includes the following bug fix<es>:

=== <TINY-vwxyz 1 changelog entry>
//#TINY-vwxyz1

// CCFR here.

=== Directly right clicking on a `<ol>`/ `<li>` in FireFox didn't enable the button `List Properties...` in the context menu
// #TINY-10490

In previous versions of {productname}, two issues where identified that affected `list properties` for `<ol><li>` tags:

. in old versions of Firefox (prior to version 121), the caret was not moved to the target position when using the right click, and;

. as {productname} creates a bookmark when there is no selection for Firefox, when a user opened a context menu the editor would jump back to the newly created bookmark.

As a consequence, since the selection is still on the first element, the menu voiceover was `disabled`.

{productname} 7.0 addresses this issue, now when the user opens a context menu, {productname} creates a new bookmark to avoid the jump back.

As a result, the selection is in the correct place and the context menu voice over is `enabled`.

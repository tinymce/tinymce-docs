== Accompanying Premium plugin changes

The following premium plugin updates were released alongside {productname} {release-version}.

=== Revision History

The {productname} {release-version} release includes an accompanying release of the **Revision History** premium plugin.

This **Revision History** release includes the following fix.

==== Reduce the chance of diff stylings being overridden by inline stylings.
// #TINY-10785

Previously in **Revision History**, the inline CSS styles of content took precedence over the diff annotation styles. As a consequence, the changes highlighted were not distinguishable to the users.

{productname} {release-version} addresses this issue by adding  an `!important` declaration to the default annotation styles. As a result, the annotation styling properties will take precedence over the inline styles, ensuring that the changes are clearly visible to the users.

NOTE: This fix assumes that the inline styles are not using `!important` declarations. If the inline styles are using `!important` declarations, the annotation styles will be overridden.

For information on the **Revision History** plugin, see: xref:revisionhistory.adoc[Revision History].

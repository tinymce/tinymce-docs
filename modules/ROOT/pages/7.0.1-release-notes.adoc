=== Table of Contents

The {productname} {release-version} release includes an accompanying release of the **Table of Contents** premium plugin.

This **Table of Contents** release includes the following fixes.

==== Encoding header of Table of Contents causing HTML source to be revealed on refresh.
// #TINY-10682

Previously in {productname}, the **Table of Contents** (ToC) header encoding caused special characters to be incorrectly displayed as code instead of their HTML representation.

To address this issue, the HTML encoding has been removed. As a result, the ToC header now renders correctly as HTML even after refreshing, displaying as intended.

For example, if the **Table of Contents** (ToC) header contained the following content with "_Contents_" emphasized as follows:

liveDemo::tiny-10682-initial[]

Upon refreshing the ToC, the header would change to display the HTML tags literally, exposing the underlying HTML:

liveDemo::tiny-10682-before[]

Now, the header maintains the intended HTML rendering even after refreshing:

liveDemo::tiny-10682-after[]

==== Encode header title for literal display in Table of Contents.
// #TINY-10789

Previously in {productname}, during Table of Contents (ToC) generation, heading elements containing HTML tags such as `<em>` for italics were incorrectly rendered within the ToC itself.

{productname} {release-version} addresses this issue by encoding the heading element during ToC generation. This ensures that any HTML tags present within the heading element are treated as plain text and displayed literally.

For example, if your document contained a heading element with HTML tags as string in the heading content, the ToC would previously render the heading element as follows:

liveDemo::tiny-10789-before[]

Now, the ToC maintains the HTML tags within the heading element as plain text, matching the heading element itself:

liveDemo::tiny-10789-after[]

For information on the **Table of Contents** plugin, see: xref:tableofcontents.adoc[Table of Contents].

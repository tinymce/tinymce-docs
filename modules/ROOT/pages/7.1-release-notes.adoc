== Accompanying Premium plugin changes

The following premium plugin updates were released alongside {productname} {release-version}.

=== Mentions

The {productname} {release-version} release includes an accompanying release of the **Mentions** premium plugin.

This **Mentions** release includes the following fix.

==== Inline editor no longer grabs focus when it has a mention in it.
// #TINY-10725

Previously in **Mentions**, when using an inline editor where the initial content included a mention, the editor automatically grabbed input focus. This unexpected behavior occurred due to the adjustment of the selection range upon initialization.

{productname} {release-version} resolves this issue, now, the selection range is only adjusted if the editor has focus. As a result, the inline editor no longer grabs focus on initialization when it has a mention in it.

For information on the **Mentions** plugin, see: xref:mentions.adoc[Mentions].

[[improvements]]
== Improvements

{productname} 7.1 also includes the following improvement<s>:

=== <TINY-vwxyz 1 changelog entry>
// #TINY-vwxyz1

// CCFR here.

=== Notification accessibility improvements: added tooltips, keyboard navigation and shortcut to focus on notifications.

In previous versions of {productname}, an accessibility issue was identified that affected keyboard-only, specifically when a user receives a notification and they where unable to close it using the keyboard.

As a consequence, users who rely on keyboard navigation or screen readers could only close the notifications via mouse "Click".

{productname} {release-version} addressed this issue with the following changes: 

* Keyboard Shortcut: keyboard shortcut `+(ALT+F12)+` was added, that allows users to now focus on notifications, providing a way for keyboard-only users to access and interact with them.
* Keyboard Navigation: allows keyboard navigation within the focusable elements in a notification, such as links and buttons, with `+tab+` or `+shift-tab+`.
* Tooltip: added a tooltip to the `close` button of the notification, providing additional context for users who may need it.
* Link Styles: improved the styles of links within notifications, including `hover`, `focus`, `active`, and `focus-visible` states, to ensure that they are easily distinguishable and navigable.
* Screen Reader Announcement: content of a notification is announced by screen readers, making it easier for visually impaired users to access and understand the information.

As a result of these changes notifications now more accessible for all users.

=== New `index.js` file that includes all plugin resources.
// #TINY-10778

Previously, integrating {productname} and its premium plugins necessitated the separate inclusion of the `plugin.js` file along with the corresponding resource API-loaded CSS files. This approach often led to complications due to inconsistent naming conventions for our CSS files, making bundling a cumbersome process.

To address this, {productname} {release-version} has included `index.js` files to each premium plugin, which will consolidate all necessary resources.

As a result, when bundling from a distribution bundle or `.zip` build, by including all the {productname} imports for each plugin such as in a `all.js` file for example;

[source, js]
----
import './plugins/a11ychecker';
import './plugins/advcode';
import './plugins/advtable';
import './plugins/advtemplate';
----
all the specific plugins will load without the need of any additional resources.

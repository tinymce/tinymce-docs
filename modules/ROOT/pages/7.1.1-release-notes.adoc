== Accompanying Premium plugin changes

The following premium plugin updates were released alongside {productname} {release-version}.

=== PowerPaste

The {productname} {release-version} release includes an accompanying release of the **PowerPaste** premium plugin.

**PowerPaste** includes the following fix.

==== List with start attribute separated by `p` tags resulted in wrong numbering of the lists.
// TINY-10585

Previously, when content from Microsoft Word contained a list that starts with a number grater than 1, and is pasted into the editor with `powerpaste` enabled, it caused all list items to display the same number.

For example, a list might appear as follows:

[source]
----
7. Point 1 
7. Point 2
7. Point 3
----

{productname} {release-version} addresses this issue. Now, all lists correctly render with the proper numbering.

For information on the **PowerPaste** plugin, see: xref:introduction-to-powerpaste.adoc[PowerPaste].

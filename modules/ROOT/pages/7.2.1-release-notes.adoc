[[bug-fixes]]
== Bug fixes

{productname} {release-version} also includes the following bug fixes:

=== <TINY-vwxyz 1 changelog entry>
// #TINY-vwxyz1

// CCFR here.

=== Cursor would shift to the start of the editor body when focus was shifted to a noneditable cell of a table.
// #TINY-10127

Previously in {productname}, when the editor did not have focus and a non-editable cell of a table was clicked, the selection was set to the non-editable cell of the table instead of the offscreen element.

As a consequence, placing the selection on the non-editable cell caused the cursor to be incorrectly placed in the editor body and unexpectedly scroll to the top of the editor.

In {productname} {release-version}, the selection handling logic has been updated. Now, the selection is maintained on the offscreen div when necessary to prevent the selection from being changed.

As a result, the selection correctly shifts to the offscreen element when required, maintaining the cursor position and no longer causing the editor to scroll unexpectedly.

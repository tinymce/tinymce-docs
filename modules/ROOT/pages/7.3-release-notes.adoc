[[accompanying-premium-plugin-changes]]
== Accompanying Premium plugin changes

The following premium plugin updates were released alongside {productname} {release-version}.

=== Enhanced Code Editor

The {productname} {release-version} release includes an accompanying release of the **Enhanced Code Editor** premium plugin.

**Enhanced Code Editor** includes the following improvements.

==== By default, code is now formatted automatically when the Enhanced Code Editor view is opened.

Previously, the Enhanced Code Editor plugin did not automatically format code with indentation, resulting in less readable source code for users.

With {productname} {release-version}, the new `advcode_prettify_editor` option has been introduced. By default, this option is set to `true`, ensuring that HTML content is automatically formatted upon opening the Enhanced Code Editor view.

Additionally, users can manually format pasted HTML code in the Enhanced Code Editor with a single click using the new "Format Code" button.

As a result, code within the Enhanced Code Editor is now more readable.

For more information on the **Enhanced Code Editor** premium plugin, see: xref:advcode.adoc[Enhanced Code Editor].

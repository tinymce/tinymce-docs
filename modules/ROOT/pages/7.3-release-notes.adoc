[[accompanying-premium-plugin-changes]]
== Accompanying Premium plugin changes

The following premium plugin updates were released alongside {productname} {release-version}.

=== Enhanced Code Editor

The {productname} {release-version} release includes an accompanying release of the **Enhanced Code Editor** premium plugin.

**Enhanced Code Editor** includes the following improvements.

==== Added new option `advcode_prettify_getcontent` to Enhanced Code Editor.

Previously, formatting HTML content within the **Enhanced Code Editor** view or retrieving formatted HTML from the `editor.getContent` API as not possible.

To resolve this issue, {productname} {release-version} introduces a new `advcode_prettify_getcontent` option. When enabled (default: false), `editor.getContent` will return formatted HTML. Additionally, invoking `+editor.getContent({ prettify: true })+` will retrieve formatted HTML content regardless of the option's status.

As a result, It is now possible to obtain formatted content through the editor API.

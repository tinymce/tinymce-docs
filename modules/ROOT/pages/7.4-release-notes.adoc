[[improvements]]
== Improvements

{productname} {release-version} also includes the following improvement<s>:

=== <TINY-vwxyz 1 changelog entry>
// #TINY-vwxyz1

// CCFR here.

=== In read-only mode the editor now allows normal cursor movement and block element selection, including video playback.
// #TINY-11264

In read-only mode, the editor now allows normal cursor movement and block element selection, including video playback. This behavior is now the **default** when the `readonly` option is set to `+true+` or when switching to read-only mode.

Prior to this improvement, the editor's body element was set to `+contentEditable="false"+`, which blocked cursor placement and all user inputs. In the new behavior, the body element is set to `+contentEditable="true"+`, and input blocking is handled by the editor.

For more information, see xref:editor-important-options.adoc#readonly[Read-only option].

[NOTE]
In this mode, menu buttons, read-only menu items, and read-only buttons remain enabled. To revert to the old behavior, use `+tinymce.activeEditor.ui.setEnabled(false)+`.

[[additions]]
== Additions

{productname} {release-version} also includes the following addition<s>:

=== <TINY-vwxyz 1 changelog entry>
// #TINY-vwxyz1

// CCFR here.


=== New `context` property for all ui components.
// #TINY-11211

A new `context` property has been introduced for all UI components, allowing buttons and menu items to be dynamically enabled or disabled based on whether their context matches a given predicate. This feature ensures that components reflect the current editing context, improving the user interface's adaptability.

The status of the UI components is updated on `init`, `NodeChange`, and `SwitchMode` events. For the `mode` context, updates occur **only** on `SwitchMode` and `init`.

To register a new context, integrators can now use:

==== Default Contexts:

- `editable`: Checks if the current selection is editable.
- `mode`: Enables components based on the current mode (e.g., `mode:design`, `mode:!readonly`).
- `any`: Always enables the UI component.
- `formatting`: Verifies if a specific format can be applied at the current selection.
- `insert`: Determines if a specific element can be inserted at the current selection.

[TIP]
Syntax for context usage is `key:value`, and negation is possible by prefixing the value with `!`. For instance, `mode:!readonly` enables a button unless the editor is in readonly mode.

This enhancement allows for more context-sensitive UI components, improving user interaction by ensuring appropriate options are available based on the editor's state.

For more information about the `context` property, see xref:context.adoc[Context].

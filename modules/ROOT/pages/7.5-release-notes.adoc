=== Comments

The {productname} {release-version} release includes an accompanying release of the **Comments** premium plugin.

**Comments** Premium plugin includes the following fixes.

==== The `conversationAuthor` property was missing from 'create` conversation events in the EventLog API.

In previous versions of the tinycomments plugin, the `conversationAuthor` property was missing from 'create' events within the event log, which led to incomplete tracking of user interactions when retrieving data through the `+getEventLog()+` API.

{productname} {release-version} addresses this issue. Now, the `conversationAuthor` property is included in 'create' events in the event log.

==== Use default 'Anon' value for `tinycomments_author` and `tinycomments_author_name` options when the provided value is an empty string.
// #TINY-11323

Previously in xref:7.4-release-notes.adoc#comments-not-functional-with-empty-tinycomments_author-and-tinycomments_author_name[{productname} 7.4.0], an issue was identified in **Embedded mode** where the commenting functionality became non-operational when either the `tinycomments_author` or the `tinycomments_author_name` options were configured as empty strings `""`. As a consequence, users were unable to create comments when these options were empty.

In {productname} {release-version}, the `tinycomments_author` and `tinycomments_author_name` options now default to "Anon" when the provided value is an empty string. As a result, the commenting functionality is now operational even when these options are empty.

For information on the **Comments** plugin, see: xref:introduction-to-tiny-comments.adoc[Introduction to {companyname} Comments].

{productname} {release-version} also includes the following bug fix<es>:

=== <TINY-vwxyz 1 changelog entry>
// #TINY-vwxyz1

// CCFR here.

=== Forecolor and backcolor toolbar buttons were not completely greyed out while in readonly mode.
// #TINY-11313

In previous versions of {productname}, an issue was identified where the `backcolor` and `forecolor` toolbar buttons were not completely greyed out while in readonly mode due to an incorrect CSS selector.

This led to a visual inconsistency in the readonly editor state.

{productname} {release-version} addresses this issue. Now, the CSS selector has been corrected, ensuring that both `backcolor` and `forecolor` buttons are now completely greyed out, providing a consistent user experience when the editor is in readonly mode.

=== Improved color picker aria support.
// #TINY-11291

In previous versions of {productname}, an issue was identified where screen readers would inconsistently announce the original R/G/B component string in the color picker, leading to a lack of context for visually impaired users. The root cause was an incorrect placement of the `aria-label` attribute, which was initially applied to the label element instead of the input field.

{productname} {release-version} addresses this issue. Now, the `aria-label` attribute has been moved to the input field to ensure it is correctly associated. Additionally, the descriptive text was updated from "Red/Green/Blue component" to "Red/Green/Blue channel" to provide clearer information for assistive technologies. These changes ensure that screen readers consistently and accurately announce the relevant RGB channels, significantly improving accessibility.

=== The `toolbar-sticky-offset` would still be applied after entering fullscreen mode.
// #TINY-11137

In previous versions of {productname}, an issue was identified where the toolbar offset was incorrectly applied in fullscreen mode, causing the toolbar to overlap with the editor area.

{productname} {release-version} addresses this issue, by implementing a check to verify that the editor is **not** in fullscreen mode before applying the toolbar offset. As a result, the toolbar now appears in the correct position when in fullscreen mode, even with the `toolbar_sticky_offset` option defined.

=== Corrected focus highlight visibility in `Statusbar` path
// #TINY-11381

A visual bug introduced in {productname} version xref:7.2.1-release-notes.adoc#long-translations-of-the-bottom-help-text-would-cause-minor-graphical-issues[7.1.2] caused the focus highlight to appear behind the tag name in the statusbar path, making it difficult for users to visually track their focus.

In {productname} {release-version}, this has been corrected. The focus highlight is now correctly displayed above the tag name when navigating through the statusbar path, ensuring a clear and visible focus indication.

=== Added new default `li` element styles to the content CSS to prevent child list elements from inheriting certain parent list item styles.
// #TINY-11217

In previous versions of {productname}, child `+<li>+` elements could inherit inline CSS styles from their parent list items, causing unexpected styling behavior in nested lists. This issue was due to native CSS behavior, where child list items would inherit certain parent styles upon post-content insertion.

{productname} {release-version} addresses this issue. Now, new default CSS styles were added for `+<li>+` elements to prevent inheritance of specific parent styles. This ensures that list items in nested structures render independently, maintaining consistent visual formatting.

=== Inability to type `{` character on German keyboard layouts

In previous versions of {productname}, an issue was identified on German Mac keyboard layouts where the `+Option+8+` keyboard combination, used to type the opening curved bracket `{`, conflicted with the `+Alt+F12+` shortcut, which is used to focus notifications in the {productname} editor. This conflict occurred because, on German Mac keyboards, `+Option+8+` generated a key code that overlapped with the `+Alt+F12+` function, preventing users from typing `{` in the editor.

To address this, {productname} {release-version} updates the keyboard event handling, implementing the `event.key` property rather than relying on numeric key codes. This solution ensures that the `{` character can be typed using `+Option+8+` on German Mac keyboards without interfering with the `+Alt+F12+` notification focus shortcut.

== Known Issues

=== Screenreader on safari has poor consistency of announcing aria-label
// #TINY-11291 & #TINY-11430

In Safari, when using a screen reader on the color picker, the focus is mistakenly placed on the content within the input field rather than the field itself. This causes the screen reader to bypass announcing the aria-label associated with the field.

As a consequence, users who rely on screen readers may not hear the intended description provided by the aria-label, potentially causing confusion or reducing accessibility.

// #TINY-11280

In {productname} {release-version}, the `MarkdownInsert` command is now registered immediately and operates asynchronously upon execution, rather than waiting for resources to register during initialization. Previously, the command required loading external content, which delayed its availability. By making the command async on execution instead of on loading, it is now accessible at initialization, improving responsiveness without the need for additional loading time.

==== Markdown command `MarkdownInsert` fires new event `MarkdownInserted` when completed.
// #TINY-11280

In {productname} {release-version}, the `MarkdownInsert` command now triggers a new event, `MarkdownInserted`, upon completion. This event provides a notification when the markdown insertion process has finished, enabling better tracking and handling of post-insertion actions within the editor.

For information on the **Markdown** plugin, see xref:markdown.adoc[Markdown].

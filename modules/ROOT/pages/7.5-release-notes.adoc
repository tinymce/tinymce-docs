=== Comments

The {productname} {release-version} release includes an accompanying release of the **Comments** premium plugin.

**Comments** Premium plugin includes the following fix.

==== The `conversationAuthor` property was missing from 'create` conversation events in the EventLog API.

In previous versions of the tinycomments plugin, the `conversationAuthor` property was missing from 'create' events within the event log, which led to incomplete tracking of user interactions when retrieving data through the `+getEventLog()+` API.

{productname} {release-version} addresses this issue. Now, the `conversationAuthor` property is included in 'create' events in the event log.

For information on the **Comments** plugin, see: xref:introduction-to-tiny-comments.adoc[Introduction to {companyname} Comments].

=== PowerPaste

The {productname} {release-version} release includes an accompanying release of the **PowerPaste** premium plugin.

**PowerPaste** Premium plugin includes the following improvement.

==== Pasting plain text with the `mceInsertClipboardContent` command is now a synchronous action, to match {productname}'s core behaviour. 

Previously in {productname}, when the Powerpaste plugin was enabled, the `mceInsertClipboardContent` command was executed asynchronously. This caused compatibility issues with the xref:markdown.adoc[Markdown] plugin, as the Markdown plugin relied on synchronous command execution. As a consequence, the Markdown plugin was effectively disabled when Powerpaste was active.

{productname} {release-version} addresses this issue. The `mceInsertClipboardContent` command has been updated to be conditionally synchronous when the Powerpaste plugin is enabled. If the content is plaintext (e.g., `+editor.execCommand('mceInsertClipboardContent', false, { text: content })+`), the command is executed synchronously, aligning it with {productname}'s core functionality. If the content is HTML (e.g., `+editor.execCommand('mceInsertClipboardContent', false, { html: content })+`), the command remains asynchronous, as it requires async operations for HTML content.

As a result, the `mceInsertClipboardContent` command now always executes synchronously when pasting plaintext, allowing both Powerpaste and the Markdown plugin to operate together seamlessly, restoring full functionality for Markdown users.

For information on the **PowerPaste** plugin, see: xref:introduction-to-powerpaste.adoc[Introduction to PowerPaste].

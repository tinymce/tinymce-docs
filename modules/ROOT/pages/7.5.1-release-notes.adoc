== Accompanying Premium plugin changes

The following premium plugin updates were released alongside {productname} {release-version}.

=== Comments

The {productname} {release-version} release includes an accompanying release of the **Comments** premium plugin.

**Comments** Premium plugin includes the following additions and fix.

==== Conversations did not load when the comments sidebar was opened on editor load with `sidebar_show`.
// #TINY-11506

In the {productname} 7.5 release of the **Comments** Plugin, the sidebar would not display comments when conversations took longer than ~200ms to be fetched. This issue occurred when the comments sidebar was set to open on editor load, such as using the `sidebar_show` option.

{productname} {release-version} addresses this issue, by ensuring that `conversationUids` are set on initialization, allowing the sidebar to properly display conversations as soon as they are retrieved.

For information on the **Comments** plugin, see: xref:introduction-to-tiny-comments.adoc[Introduction to {companyname} Comments].

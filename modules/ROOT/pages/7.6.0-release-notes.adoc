[[accompanying-premium-plugin-changes]]
== Accompanying Premium plugin changes

The following premium plugin updates were released alongside {productname} {release-version}.

=== Accessibility Checker

The {productname} {release-version} release includes an accompanying release of the **Accessibility Checker** premium plugin.

**Accessibility Checker** Premium plugin includes the following fixes and improvements.

==== Improve editor content highlighting when using accessibility checker
// #TINY-11463

Previously, an issue involving the accessibility checker was identified where the content area highlights did not properly meet accessibility standards. This issue caused users with vision impairments to encounter difficulty in identifying the currently focused element.

In {productname} {release-version}, this issue has been resolved by unifying the color palette to meet accessibility color contrast standards, ensuring that all users can easily locate the currently focused element.

For information on the **Accessibility Checker** plugin, see: xref:a11ychecker.adoc[Accessibility Checker].

=== Checklist

The {productname} {release-version} release includes an accompanying release of the **Checklist** premium plugin.

**Checklist** Premium plugin includes the following fix.

==== Checklist items were unresponsive in `center` or `right` alignments
// #TINY-11357

In previous versions of {productname}, an issue was identified where users could not check checklist items when they were `center` or `right` aligned. This occurred because the logic for detecting clicks relied on the left-most position of the `+<li>+` element, which remains unchanged regardless of text alignment.

As a result, clicks in center or right alignments would fail the logic check, leaving the items unresponsive.

{productname} {release-version} addresses this issue. Now, the logic compares the click position against the left-most position of the aligned text, rather than the parent `+<li>+` element. This adjustment ensures that clicks are properly registered regardless of alignment, restoring expected functionality across all alignment settings.

For information on the **Checklist** plugin, see: xref:checklist.adoc[Checklist].

=== Comments

The {productname} {release-version} release includes an accompanying release of the **Comments** premium plugin.

**Comments** includes the following fixes and improvements.

==== Allow mentions in comments dropdown to flow freely outside of the editor container
// #TINY-11504

An issue was identified where the mentions in comments dropdown didn't freely expand to the available space alongside mentions in the editor. This was due to the dropdown being restricted within the sidebar area.

In {productname} {release-version}, this issue has been resolved by allowing the mentions in comments dropdown to expand outside the sidebar area, making full use of the available space outside the editor and improving the overall user experience.

==== Scroll to show action buttons when replying/editing a comment.
// #TINY-11402

Previously, if a selected conversation card was positioned near the bottom of the sidebar, the reply/edit input field would be below the bottom of the sidebar resulting in the comment input field not being visible to the user.

{productname} {release-version} addresses this issue. Now, the sidebar scrolls to display the comment input field if the selected conversation card is positioned near the bottom of the sidebar. This ensures that the comment input field is always visible to the user.

==== Pressing Shift+Enter in Mentions in Comments dropdown should accept the active menu item
// #TINY-11455

In previous versions of {productname}, the `Shift+Enter` key was not properly handled when used with mentions in comments. This led to a new line being inserted while the mentions dropdown remained open, resulting in inconsistent behavior compared to mentions within the editor.

In {productname} {release-version}, mentions in comments now handle the `Shift+Enter` key by inserting the highlighted user into the comment text area and closing the dropdown, ensuring consistent functionality across the editor and comment areas.

For information on the **Comments** plugin, see: xref:introduction-to-tiny-comments.adoc[Introduction to {companyname} Comments].

== New `+disabled+` option for disabling all user interactions

A new `+disabled+` option has been introduced to {productname} in version {release-version}. This option allows integrators to disable all user interactions with the editor, including cursor placement, content modifications, and UI components. When set to `+true+`, the editor behaves similarly to the readonly mode changes introduced in {productname} 7.4.0 but ensures complete non-interactivity.

.Example disabling all user interactions with the editor
[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // Specify the target HTML element
  disabled: true         // Disables all interactions with the editor
});
----

[[bug-fixes]]
== Bug fixes

{productname} {release-version} also includes the following bug fixes:

=== Tooltip would not show for group toolbar button.
// #TINY-11391

Previously, an issue was identified where tooltips were not displayed when hovering over toolbar group buttons. This was due to replacing the `title` attribute with an `aria-label` attribute in xref:7.0-release-notes.adoc#improved-accessibility-for-interactive-elements-with-custom-tooltips[{productname} 7.0.0] without implementing the custom tooltip behavior for the toolbar group buttons.

In {productname} {release-version}, this issue has been resolved by applying the custom tooltip behavior to the toolbar group buttons, ensuring that tooltips are now displayed on hover.

=== Numbered table context menu not properly applying changes
// #TINY-11383

Previously, there was an issue where changes to the row type in numbered tables were not properly applied. This occurred because the action of modifying the row type from a `+contentEditable="false"+` cell was being deliberately blocked.

In {productname} {release-version}, this issue has been resolved by removing the restriction on changing the row type from a `+contentEditable="false"+` cell. As a result, changes to the row type are now correctly applied.

The {pluginname} plugin, depending on its setting, can replace common typewriter-style characters with their professional typesetter equivalents after the _Advanced Typography_ button is pressed. This action will modify either the entire content for the {productname} document or the specific text selection highlighted by the user.

For example, if English-language typography rules are set, the {pluginname} plugin can automatically replace an open-hyphen (`-`) with an em-dash (`—`). And it can automatically replace the teardrop apostrophe (`'`) with opening and closing quote marks (`‘` and `’`).

== Advanced Typography plugin rules

The {pluginname} plugin rules are sourced from the https://github.com/typograf/typograf[typograf] library.

However, the {pluginname} plugin only uses a sub-set of all the rules available in this library.

Of the library’s full https://github.com/typograf/typograf/blob/dev/docs/RULES.en-US.md[Rules of typograf] list, the {pluginname} plugin uses the following:

* common/space/delBeforePunctuation
* common/space/afterComma
* common/space/afterColon
* common/space/delBetweenExclamationMarks
* common/space/afterExclamationMark
* common/space/afterQuestionMark
* common/space/afterSemicolon
* common/space/beforeBracket
* common/space/bracket
* common/space/delBeforeDot
* common/space/delBeforePercent
* common/space/squareBracket
* common/number/mathSigns
* common/number/times
* common/number/fraction
* common/symbols/arrow
* common/symbols/cf
* common/symbols/copy
* common/punctuation/delDoublePunctuation
* common/punctuation/hellip
* common/nbsp/afterSectionMark
* common/punctuation/quote
* en-US/dash/main
* common/nbsp/afterParagraphMark
* common/nbsp/afterShortWord
* common/nbsp/beforeShortLastNumber
* common/nbsp/beforeShortLastWord
* common/nbsp/dpi
* common/punctuation/apostrophe

No other typograf rules are used and the {pluginname} plugin cannot be configured to use any typograf rules other than those listed above.

NOTE: The {pluginname} plugin affects text only. It does not modify the underlying HTML markup.

== Basic setup

To add the {pluginname} plugin to the editor, add `{plugincode}` to the `plugins` option in the editor configuration.

NOTE: The {pluginname} plugin requires a `typography_default_lang` be configured.


For example:

[source,js,subs="attributes+"]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  plugins: '{plugincode}',
  toolbar: '{plugincode}',
  typography_default_lang: [ "en-US" ], // Required to set specific typography language rules.
});
----

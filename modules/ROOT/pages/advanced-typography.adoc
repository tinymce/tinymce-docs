The {pluginname} plugin, depending on its setting, can replace common typewriter-style characters with their professional typesetter equivalents after the _Advanced Typography_ button is pressed. This action will modify either the entire content for the {productname} document or the specific text selection highlighted by the user.

For example, if English-language typography rules are set, the {pluginname} plugin can automatically replace an open-hyphen (`-`) with an em-dash (`—`). And it can automatically replace the teardrop apostrophe (`'`) with opening and closing quote marks (`‘` and `’`).

NOTE: The {pluginname} plugin rules are sourced from the https://github.com/typograf/typograf[typograf] library.

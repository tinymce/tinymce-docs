The xref:advcode.adoc[Advanced Code Editor] plugin (`+advcode+`) brings a more advanced code editor to {productname}. This code editor makes it easier to modify the HTML, and is a useful add-on for power users. It comes with features often found in IDEs, all enabled by default:

* Bracket matching.
* Code folding.
* Multiple selections/carets.
* Search and Replace.
* Dark or light mode button for code display.
* Increase and decrease display font size buttons.

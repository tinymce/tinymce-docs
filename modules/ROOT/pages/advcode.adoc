== Options

=== Advanced Code Inline Mode

This option will allow users to open the Advanced Code Editor within {productname}'s existing editor space instead of been displayed in a seperate dialog box. 

The benefits for using `advcode` inside {productname} is that mobile and narrow screen users do not require to have a `ToggleView` button, as `advcode` forces the editor to open within the existing editor space in inline mode.

Type : `boolean`,

Default: false

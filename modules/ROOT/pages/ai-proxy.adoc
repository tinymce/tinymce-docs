== What is an Ai proxy server?

A proxy is a server that sits between the browser containing the {productname} editor and the Ai LLM, eg: OpenAi server.  The browser does not communicate directly to the Ai LLM, instead goes through the proxy.  The ai enhanced responses from the LLM go back through the proxy then to the browser. 

== Why do I need a proxy service?
-- To hide my OpenAi key, as recommended by OpenAi
-- It allows many users on different browsers to work with 1 OpenAi key
-- It can validate logged in users and reject unauthorised usage of the OpenAi service.
-- [Optional] It allows for extra processing before sending the request to OpenAi, eg: filtering for abusive content and rejecting before OpenAi proceses it.
-- [Optional] It allows for extra processing when the server responds to the browser, eg: modifying the response, or reformatting.



For example:

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  plugins: '{{plugincode}}',
  toolbar: '<toolbar-button(s)>',
  an_essential_option: false
});
----

// Delete everything not require/relevant from this point on.

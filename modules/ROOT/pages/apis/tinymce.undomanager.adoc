[[add]]
=== add()
[source, javascript]
----
add(level: Object, event: DOMEvent): Object

* `event (DOMEvent)` - Optional event responsible for the creation of the undo level.

==== Return value

* `Object` - Undo level that got added or null if a level wasn't needed.

'''

[[beforeChange]]
=== beforeChange()
[source, javascript]
----
beforeChange()
----
Stores away a bookmark to be used when performing an undo action so that the selection is before
the change has been made.

'''

[[clear]]
=== clear()
[source, javascript]
----
clear()
----
Removes all undo levels.

'''

[[dispatchChange]]
=== dispatchChange()
[source, javascript]
----
dispatchChange()
----
Dispatch a change event with current editor status as level and current undoManager layer as lastLevel

'''

[[extra]]
=== extra()
[source, javascript]
----
extra(callback1: Function, callback2: Function)
----
Adds an extra "hidden" undo level by first applying the first mutation and store that to the undo stack
then roll back that change and do the second mutation on top of the stack. This will produce an extra
undo level that the user doesn't see until they undo.

==== Parameters

* `callback1 (Function)` - Function that does mutation but gets stored as a "hidden" extra undo level.
* `callback2 (Function)` - Function that does mutation but gets displayed to the user.

'''

[[hasRedo]]
=== hasRedo()
[source, javascript]
----
hasRedo(): Boolean
----
Returns true/false if the undo manager has any redo levels.

==== Return value

'''

[[hasUndo]]
=== hasUndo()
[source, javascript]
----
hasUndo(): Boolean
----
Returns true/false if the undo manager has any undo levels.

==== Return value

* `Boolean` - true/false if the undo manager has any undo levels.

'''

[[ignore]]
=== ignore()
[source, javascript]
----
ignore(callback: Function)
----
Executes the specified mutator function as an undo transaction. But without adding an undo level.
Any logic within the translation that adds undo levels will be ignored. So a translation can
include calls to execCommand or editor.insertContent.

==== Parameters

* `callback (Function)` - Function that gets executed and has dom manipulation logic in it.

'''

be ignored. So a translation can include calls to execCommand or editor.insertContent.

==== Parameters

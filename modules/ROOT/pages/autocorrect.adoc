The {pluginname} plugin allows {productname} to autocorrect a specified set of spelling errors, common typos, and capitalization errors, as they are being typed.

----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  plugins: 'autocorrect'
});

[[usage-notes]]
== Usage notes

The {pluginname} plugin currently has the following limitations:

. English is the only supported language.

. Capitalization and autocorrect can both be turned off, but specific autocorrections cannot.
+
{pluginname} can be entirely turned off, but there is, currently, no way of instructing the plugin to ignore a particular string that it considers a mis-spelling.
+
For example, if `+cna+` (which the {pluginname} plugin treats as a mis-typing of *can*) is a desired string in a particular use-case, turning the {pluginname} plugin off is currently recommended.

. Autocorrect and capitalization are not available as toolbar buttons. They are only available as menu items.

. Spelling Autocorrect is case-sensitive.
+
As a consequence, mis-spelled words are not autocorrected if they do not exactly match the pluginâ€™s built-in correction set.
+
For example, {pluginname} autocorrects *teh* to *the*, but does not, currently, autocorrect *Teh* to *The*.

[[known-issues]]
== Known issues

The {pluginname} plugin has the following known issues:

. Autocorrect over-rides auto-capitalization.
+
As a consequence of {pluginname} being case-sensitive, if
+
  * both `autocorrect` and `capitalization` are active; and
  * a word from the specified spelling error set is mis-typed at the beginning of a sentence;
+
the spelling is corrected but the initial letter is not capitalized.

. Auto-capitalization does not work on text immediately following a soft return in non-empty {productname} documents.
+
Auto-capitalization will not operate on the entered string if
+
  * a {productname} document contains any data other than a soft return character (Unicode U+2028, commonly entered by typing *Shift+Return*); and
  * the character immediately preceding an entered string is a soft return character.
+

. Auto-capitalization interferes with `+mediaembed+`, the xref:introduction-to-mediaembed.adoc[Enhanced Media Embed] Premium plugin.

. Auto-capitalization interferes with `linkchecker`, the xref:linkchecker.adoc[Link Checker] Premium plugin.

. When the Spell Checker Pro plugin is used, autocorrection is disabled when a non-English language is selected.
+
When the {pluginname} is used with the xref:introduction-to-tiny-spellchecker.adoc[Spell Checker Pro] Premium plugin, autocorrection and capitalization are disabled when a non-English language is selected.
+
Autocorrection and capitalization can, however, be re-enabled by selecting the *Tools > Autocorrect* menu item and the *Tools > Capitalization* menu item respectively.

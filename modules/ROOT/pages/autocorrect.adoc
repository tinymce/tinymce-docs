The {pluginname} plugin allows {productname} to autocorrect a specified set of spelling errors or capitalization errors, as they are being typed.

[[limitations]]
== Limitations

The {pluginname} plugin currently has the following limitations:

. English is the only supported language.

. Capitalization and autocorrect can both be turned off, but specific autocorrections cannot.
+
For example, Spelling Autocorrect can be entirely turned off, but there is, currently, no way of instructing the plugin to ignore a particular string that it considers a mis-spelling. If *cna* (which the plugin treats as a mis-typing of *can*) is a desired string in a particular use-case, turning Spelling Autocorrect off is the currently recommended setting.

. End-users cannot turn Autocorrect on or off on hand-held devices.

[[known-issues]]
== Known issues

The {pluginname} plugin also has the following known issues:

. Switching to a language other than English disables the Autocorrect and Capitalization menus
+
When the `autocorrect` plugin loads, *Autocorrect* and *Capitalization* menu items are added to the *Tools* menu.
+
If {productname} is then switched to a language other than English, both these menu items are disabled. And they are not automatically re-enabled if a user switches back to English.

. Spelling Autocorrect is case-sensitive.
+
As a consequence, mis-spelled words are not auto-corrected if they do not exactly match the pluginâ€™s built-in correction set.
+
For example, Spelling Autocorrect auto-corrects *teh* to *the*, but does not auto-correct *Teh* to *The*.

. Spelling Autocorrect over-rides auto-capitalization.
+
As a consequence of both this and Spelling Autocorrect being case-sensitive, if
+
  * `autocorrect` and `capitalization` are both active; and
  * a word from the specified spelling error set is mis-typed at the beginning of a sentence;
+
the spelling is corrected but the initial letter is not capitalized.

. Auto-capitalization does not work on text immediately following a soft return in non-empty {productname} documents.
+
If
+
  * a {productname} document contains any data other than a soft return character (Unicode U+2028, commonly entered by typing *Shift+Return*); and
  * the character immediately preceding an entered string is a soft return character
+
Auto-capitalization will not operate on the entered string.

. Auto-capitalization interferes with media embeds.

. Auto-capitalization interferes with `linkchecker`.

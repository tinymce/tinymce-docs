The {pluginname} plugin adds capabilties to TinyMCE to autocorrect a specified set of spelling errors or capitalization errors, as they are being typed.

== Limitations and known issues

The {pluginname} plugin has a few limitations or known issues that should be noted:

* Currently, only the English language is supported.
* With both autocorrect and capitalization enabled, when a misspelt word is typed at the beginning of a sentence, the word is corrected but not capitalized.

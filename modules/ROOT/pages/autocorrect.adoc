The {pluginname} plugin allows {productname} to autocorrect a specified set of spelling errors or capitalization errors, as they are being typed.

== Limitation

The {pluginname} plugin has the following limitation:

* English is currently the only supported language.

== Known issue

The {pluginname} plugin also has the following known issue:

* Autocorrect, in effect, over-rides auto-capitalization.

As a consequence, if

1. `autocorrect` and `capitalization` are both active; and

2. a word from the specified spelling error set is mis-typed at the beginning of a sentence;

the spelling is corrected but the initial letter is not capitalized.

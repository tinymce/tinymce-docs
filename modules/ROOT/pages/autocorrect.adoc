The {pluginname} plugin adds capabilties to TinyMCE to autocorrect a specified set of spelling errors or capitalization errors, as they are being typed.

== Limitations and known issues

The {pluginname} plugin has limitations or known issues that should be noted:

* English is currently the only supported language.
* If both autocorrect and capitalization are enabled and a word is mis-typed at the beginning of a sentence, the spelling is corrected but the initial letter is not capitalized.

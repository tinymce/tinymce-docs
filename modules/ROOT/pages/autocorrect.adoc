The {pluginname} plugin automatically corrects a specified set of spelling errors, capitalization errors, or both, as they are being typed.

== Interactive Example

liveDemo::autocorrect[]

include::partial$misc/purchase-premium-plugins.adoc[]

== Basic setup

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  plugins: 'autocorrect'
});
----

The {pluginname} plugin has a few limitations or known issues that should be noted:

* Currently, only the English language is supported.
* With both autocorrect and capitalization enabled, when a misspelt word word is typed at the beginning of a sentence, the word is corrected but not capitalized.

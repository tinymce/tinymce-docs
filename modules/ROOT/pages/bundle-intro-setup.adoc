:navtitle: Introduction and initial setup
:description: The containerized server-side components for premium plugins.

The {enterpriseversion} server-side components can be deployed on Docker orchestration applications such as https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes], https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/[Docker Swarm], or https://www.openshift.com/[OpenShift]. {companyname} provides packages containing pre-configured https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/[`+Dockerfiles+`] for building and deploying the {enterpriseversion} server-side components using Docker.

== Containerized services for Self-hosted Enterprise deployments

The following sections assist with containerizing the {productname} services for users with licenses to the Self-hosted {productname} Enterprise bundles:

* The *Self-hosted Essential* bundle.
* The *Self-hosted Professional* bundle.
* The *Self-hosted Premium* bundle.

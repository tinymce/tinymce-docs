== Changing the case of selected text

Perform the following steps to change the case of selected text in a document to lowercase, UPPERCASE, or Title Case:

. Select the desired text to change the case.
. Click on the image:casechangeicon.png[Case Change] icon in the toolbar.
. From the drop-down menu, choose the desired format by clicking on either *lowercase*, *UPPERCASE*, or *Title Case*.

NOTE: The toolbar button will retain the last applied type of case making it simple to apply the same formatting multiple times.

== Types of Formats

Currently, there are three types of formats available:

=== lowercase

The *lowercase* option changes all the selected characters to lowercase.

=== UPPERCASE

The *UPPERCASE* option changes all the selected characters to uppercase.

=== Title Case

The *Title Case* option changes anything other than articles, coordinating conjunctions, or short prepositions to capital letters. The default rule set for *Title Case* is based on https://titlecaseconverter.com/rules/#WP[Wikipedia Title Case].

==== Title Case options

*Title Case* can be customized to create user defined rule sets by using the following options:

NOTE: This is the {productname} Community version changelog. For information about the latest {cloudname} or {enterpriseversion} Release, see: xref:release-notes.adoc[{productname} Release Notes].

== 6.6.0 - 2023-07-12

=== Fixed
* Fixed an issue that prevented setting the inline dialog `size` to _medium_ or _normal_.

=== Added
* Added new `bottom` to inline dialog type. This new inline dialog option allows the inline dialog to be positioned at the bottom of the editor.
* Added new `persistent` option to `WindowParams`. This new option allows the inline dialog to be persistent, meaning that it will not be closed when the user clicks outside of the dialog.
* New `ai`, `ai-prompt` and `send` icons.
* New `streamContent` property for the `iframe` dialog component which controls dialog `setData()` behavior. With the property set to `true`, frame content will update with `document.write()` to avoid reloading the frame, and end scroll positions will be maintained as new content streams in.
* Added `ai` buttons to the default toolbar and menubar.
* New `border` property for the `iframe` dialog component which controls the visibility of its border.
* New `align` property for the label dialog component that controls text alignment.

=== Changed
* The icon in an `alertbanner` dialog component is not clickable if the _URL_ field is not specified.

=== Improved
* When defining a modal or inline dialog, if the `buttons` property is `undefined` or an empty array, the footer will now no longer be rendered.

== 6.5.1 - 2023-06-19

=== Fixed
* Fixed a regression where pasting an image url would result in the url being inserted as plain text instead of the image being inserted.
* It was not possible to press space to insert a space character inside a summary element on Firefox.

== 6.5.0 - 2023-06-13

=== Added
* Support for the `h` hash parameter in Vimeo video URLs in the Media plugin.
* New `table_merge_content_on_paste` option which disables the merging behaviour when pasting a table inside an existing table.
* New optional `defaultExpandedIds` and `onToggleExpand` options to the `tree` component config.
* New optional `defaultSelectedId` option to the `tree` component config.
* New `accordion` plugin with the `InsertAccordion` command.
* New `accordion` and `accordion-toggle` icons.
* New `details_initial_state` and `details_serialized_state` options.
* New `init_content_sync` option that initializes the editor iframe using `document.write` instead of `srcdoc`.
* New `newdocument_content` option that sets the content presented in the editor on choosing *File -> New document* or pressing the *New document* toolbar button.
* New `editable_root` option that can be set to `false` to prevent editing of the editor’s root element.
* New `editor.setEditableRoot` API that sets the editable state of the editor root element.
* New `editor.hasEditableRoot` API that returns `true` or `false` depending on the editable state of the editor root element.
* New `EditableRootStateChange` event that gets dispatched when the state of the editable root is changed.
* Added Oxide styles for `dl`, `dt`, `dd`, `ol`, and `strong` elements in dialog body content.

=== Improved
* Screen readers can now announce highlighted items listed in the Link dialog’s link combobox.

* Translations added for Help text displayed at *Help > Help > Keyboard Navigation*.
* For word count purposes these characters are now considered punctuation marks: *$*, *~*, *+*, *|*, *№*, and *`*. They no longer increase a document’s word count.
* Updated the `codesample` plugin dialog and the `template` plugin dialog to use the `listbox` component to match other dialogs.
* If the selection contains more than one table cell, Quickbar toolbars are now positioned in the middle of the selection horizontally.
* Exposed `dataTransfer` property of drag and drop events for elements with a `contenteditable="false"` attribute.
* Screen readers now announce instructions for resizing the editor using arrow keys, when the resize handle is focused.
* Dialog `tabpanel` tab labels are now allowed to word wrap for better readability with long labels.
* Added newlines before and after `details` elements in the output HTML.
* Added padding for empty `summary` elements so they can be properly edited.

=== Changed
* The `caption`, `address` and `dt` elements no longer incorrectly allow non-inline child elements when the editor schema is set to _HTML 4_.

* Initiating the editor with a table as the first element resulted in resize handles being displayed around the table even when the editor did not have focus.

* Inserting two tables consecutively without focus in the editor resulted in the second table being inserted at the wrong position.
* Pasting content into the editor did not fire `beforeinput` and `input` events.
* In some cases, exiting a `blockquote` element could fail when the insertion point was positioned at the end of the `blockquote`.
* Templates containing an `<html>` tag were not parsed before being rendered for preview.
* Typing after deleting formatted content could remove a space at the start of the typing.
* Invalid markup in Notification and Dialog close buttons.
* In dialogs, an incorrect `aria-describedby` attribute caused the dialog body to be announced when using a screen reader.
* The sticky toolbar did not render correctly when transitioning from the custom editor view to the main view.
* Saving the Table Properties dialog after changing properties unrelated to cells would overwrite cell properties set by the Cell Properties dialog.

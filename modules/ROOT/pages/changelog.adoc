[NOTE]

* New custom tooltip functionality, tooltip will be shown when hovering with a mouse or with keyboard focus.
* New `sandbox_iframes_exclusions` option that holds a list of URL host names to be excluded from iframe sandboxing when `sandbox_iframes` is set to true.
* Added `getAllEmojis` api function to the emoticons plugin.
* Element preset support for the `valid_children` option and `Schema.addValidChildren` API.
* A new `trigger` property for block text pattern configurations, allowing pattern activation with either `Space` or `Enter` keys.
* Added `onFocus` callback for `CustomEditor` dialog component.
* Added icons for the import from Word, export to Word and export to PDF premium plugins.
* Added `data` to Schema as a valid element.
* More advanced schema config for custom elements.
* Added custom tooltip for `autocompleter`, now visible on both mouse hover and keyboard focus, except single column cases.
* Added importword, exportpdf and exportword menu items to default file menu.

=== Improved
* Included keyboard shortcut in custom tooltip for `ToolbarButton` and `ToolbarToggleButton`.
* Improved showing which element has focus for keyboard navigation.
* Custom tooltips will now show for items in `collection` which is rendered inside a dialog, on mouse hover and keyboard focus.
* Autocompleter will now work with IMEs.

=== Changed
* TinyMCE is now GPL Version 2 or later licensed.
* `convert_unsafe_embeds` editor option is now defaulted to `true`.
* `sandbox_iframes` editor option is now defaulted to `true`.
* The DOMUtils.isEmpty API function has been modified to consider nodes containing only comments as empty.
* The `highlight_on_focus` option now defaults to `true`, adding a focus outline to every editor.
* Delay before the tooltip to show up, from 800ms to 300ms.
* Now `tox-view__pane` has `position: relative` instead of `static`.
* Update outbound link for statusbar Tiny logo
* Remove the height field from the `table` plugin cell dialog. The `table` plugin row dialog now controls the row height by setting the height on the `tr` element, not the `td` elements.
* Change table height resizing handling to remove heights from `td/th` elements and only apply to `tr` elements.
* Removed incorrect `aria-placeholder` attribute from editor body when placeholder option is set.
* The tooltip property for dialog's footer `togglebutton` is now optional.
* Changed the `media_url_resolver` option to use promises.
* `Styles` bespoke toolbar button fallback changed to `Formats` if `Paragraph` is not configured in `style_formats` option.
* Updated deprecation/removed console message.

=== Removed
* Removed `force_hex_color` option, with the default now being all colors are forced to HEX format and as lower case
* Removed the deprecated `remove_trailing_brs` option from DomParser.
* Removed `title` attribute for buttons with visible label.
* Removed `InsertOrderedList` and `InsertUnorderedList` commands from core.
* Removed `closeButton` from `NotificationSpec`, close button in notification is now rendered by default.
* The autocompleter `ch` configuration property has been removed. Use the `trigger` property instead.
* Removed deprecated `template` plugin.

=== Fixed
* When deleting the last row in a table, the cursor would jump to the first cell (top left), instead of moving to the next adjacent cell in some cases.
* Heading formatting would be partially applied to the content within the `summary` element when the caret was positioned between words.
* Moving focus to the outside of the editor after having clicked a menu would not fire a `blur` event as expected.
* Autocomplete would sometimes cause corrupt data when starting during text composition.
* Inline mode with persisted toolbar would show regardless of the skin being loaded, causing css issues.
* Table classes couldn't be removed via setting an empty value in `table_class_list`. Also fixed being forced to pick the first class option.
* Directly right clicking on a ol's li in FireFox didn't enable the button `List Properties...` in the context menu.
* The `link_default_target` option wasn't considered when inserting a link via `quicklink` toolbar.
* When inline editor toolbar wrapped to multiple lines the top wasn't always calculated correctly.
* Removed manually dispatching `dragend` event on drop in Firefox.
* Slovenian help dialog content had a dot in the wrong place.
* Pressing Backspace at the start of an empty `summary` element within a details element nested in a list item no longer removes the `summary` element.
* The toolbar width was miscalculated for the inline editor positioned inside a scrollable container.
* Fixed incorrect object processor for `event_root` option.
* Adding newline after using `selection.setContent` to insert a block element would throw an unhandled exception.
* Floating toolbar buttons in inline editor incorrectly wrapped into multiple rows on window resizing or zooming.
* When setting table border width and `table_style_by_css` is true, only the border attribute is set to 0 and border-width styling is no longer used.

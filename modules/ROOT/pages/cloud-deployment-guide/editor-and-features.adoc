{{site.cloudname}} is the easiest way to integrate {{site.productname}} and upgrade to premium plugins.

{{site.cloudname}} can be used without an API key. Refer to the link:{{site.baseurl}}/general-configuration-guide[Introduction & getting started] guide for more information. Sign up for an API key and update the script tag to use premium plugins or avoid the in-editor developer warning.

All {{site.cloudname}} accounts include a free, pre-configured {{site.cloudname}} image proxy service. This setup uses the link:{{site.baseurl}}/plugins/opensource/imagetools/[Image tools] plugin.

== Integrating TinyMCE for the first time

=== Step 1: Insert the Tiny Cloud script tag into the webpage

Insert the {{site.productname}} editor code into the application to load {{site.productname}} for the first time. The code inserting is done by adding the following script tag into your app, or in the case of a web page the `<head>` of the page:

The following example adds a script tag into the application that inserts the code. Use the `<head>` of the page on a web page. Be sure to substitute 'no-api-key' with your api key.

`html
<script src="{{ site.cdnurl }}" referrerpolicy="origin"></script>
`

|===
|  | Value | Description

| 1
| no-api-key
| Replace with your api key

| 2
| origin=
| A `referrerpolicy` specifies how much of the current page's URL is sent in the `Referer` header when the browser fetches page resources (for example, the {{site.productname}} editor). The use of the `Referer` header ensures API keys are only used on domains registered to their owners. We only care about the domain portion however (similar to the operation of `Origin` header), so for improved performance and privacy always set the `referrerpolicy` to `origin` when requesting {{site.cloudname}} resources.

____
IMPORTANT: {{site.cloudname}} verifies the domain {{site.productname}} is loading from by checking the *Referer* header in the network request. Sometimes the domains in the *Referer* header does not match with the URL in the browser's address bar.

To check the *Referer* header, open your browser's _Developer's Tools_ and open the _Network_ tab. From there, find the request being made to load {{site.productname}} with your API key, and click on the *Headers* tab.  In the section called *Request Headers* there should be a field for *Referer*. If the value there is different from one of your registered URLs, you may need to adjust either your registered URLs, or your application's *Refer* header settings.

=== Step 2: Load, customize and interact with TinyMCE

There are more than 40 open source plugins that enhance the editing experience in addition to the advanced content create solutions on {{site.cloudname}}. A range of link:{{ site.baseurl }}/demo/basic-example/[simple examples] are available. Refer to the link:{{ site.baseurl }}/quick-start[Quick start] section for more information.

=== Step 3: Specifying purchased TinyMCE plugins and toolbar/menu items

Extend the link:{{ site.baseurl }}/configure/[{{site.productname}} configuration] to include any additional purchased plugins and associated toolbar and menu items. Refer to the following enablement guides for more information:

* link:{{site.baseurl}}/plugins/premium/mentions/[Mentions]
* link:{{ site.baseurl }}/plugins/premium/tinydrive/[{{site.cloudfilemanager}}]
* link:{{site.baseurl}}/plugins/premium/comments/[Comments]
* link:{{site.baseurl}}/plugins/premium/pageembed/[Page Embed]
* link:{{site.baseurl}}/plugins/premium/permanentpen/[Permanent Pen]
* link:{{site.baseurl}}/plugins/premium/formatpainter/[Format Painter]
* link:{{site.baseurl}}/plugins/premium/powerpaste/[PowerPaste]
* link:{{site.baseurl}}/plugins/premium/tinymcespellchecker/[Spell Checker Pro]

NOTE: `spellchecker_rpc_url` is *not* required when enabling this plugin via link:{{ site.baseurl }}/cloud-deployment-guide/[{{site.cloudname}}].

* link:{{site.baseurl}}/plugins/opensource/imagetools/[Image Tools (with configured image proxy)]

NOTE: Configuration of the `imagetools_cors_hosts` and `imagetools_proxy` properties occurs automatically.

* link:{{site.baseurl}}/plugins/premium/moxiemanager/[Moxie Manager]
* link:{{site.baseurl}}/plugins/premium/a11ychecker/[Accessibility Checker]
* link:{{site.baseurl}}/plugins/premium/advcode/[Advanced Code Editor]
* link:{{site.baseurl}}/plugins/premium/mediaembed/[Enhanced Media Embed]
* link:{{site.baseurl}}/plugins/premium/linkchecker/[Link Checker]

NOTE: It may take up to 30 minutes for the purchased plugin to be available to {{site.productname}}. Clear the browser's cache.

=== Step 4: Forward proxy configuration

Ensure that the following URLs are accessible via this proxy if the network has a forward proxy that controls access to the internet.

* All URLs where the editor is deployed.
* All URLs where the plugins are deployed.
* \https://imageproxy.tiny.cloud
* \https://hyperlinking.tiny.cloud
* \https://spelling.tiny.cloud

Ensure the `tiny-api-key` and `tinymce-api-key` headers are retained while requesting the list of above URLs.

=== Step 5: Specifying a translation

To change the user interface language with a language pack, use the link:{{ site.baseurl }}/configure/localization/#language[language configuration option].

Alternatively, link:{{site.gettiny}}/language-packages/[download a language pack] to enable a language other than English (US). link:{{ site.baseurl }}/configure/localization/#language_url[Specify its location] with the `language_url` configuration option.

== Migrating from a self-hosted environment to Tiny Cloud

=== Step 1: Replace existing reference to tinymce.min.js

Migrating from a self-hosted environment to {{site.cloudname}} is easy. Remove the existing script tag that loads {{site.productname}}`'s JavaScript.

NOTE: The script tag typically references `tinymce.min.js` hosted within the application or available at a legacy CDN.

Replace the script tag with the following:

`html
<script src="{{ site.cdnurl }}" referrerpolicy="origin"></script>
`

=== Step 2: Update custom plugin paths

Reference link:{{ site.baseurl }}/configure/integration-and-setup/#external_plugins[external_plugins] to ensure custom plugins or modified plugins continue to function in the {{site.cloudname}} deployment.

WARNING: Do not use the regular link:{{ site.baseurl }}/general-configuration-guide/work-with-plugins/[plugins] configuration element.

=== Step 3: Specify purchased TinyMCE plugins and toolbar buttons

Extend the link:{{ site.baseurl }}/configure/[{{site.productname}} configuration] to include any additional purchased plugins and associated toolbar and menu items. Refer to the following enablement guides for more information:

* link:{{site.baseurl}}/plugins/premium/mentions/[Mentions]

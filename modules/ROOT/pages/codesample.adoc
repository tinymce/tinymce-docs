The Code Sample plugin (`+codesample+`) lets a user insert and embed syntax color highlighted code snippets into the editable area. It also adds a button to the toolbar which on click will open a dialog box to accept raw code input.

== Basic setup

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  plugins: 'codesample',
  toolbar: 'codesample'
});
----

By default, `+codesample+` uses `+http://prismjs.com/+` to embed the code samples within the editor and works out of the box. That is, when a user copies valid code syntax into the editable area the code will be automatically formatted according to Prism default CSS rules.

NOTE: Prism.js and prism.css need to be added to a page for syntax highlighting to work. See the instructions below to learn how to do this.

== Using Prism.js on your web page

You need to add `+prism.js+` and `+prism.css+` to your page in order to get the syntax highlighted code samples on your webpage (as created by the Code Sample plugin). The Code Sample plugin uses the following languages: markup, javascript, css, php, ruby, python, java, c, csharp and cpp. You can generate the `+prism.js+` and `+prism.css+` files on the http://prismjs.com/download.html[download] page at the Prism website.

include::partial$commands/comments-cmds.adoc[]

== Events

include::partial$events/tinycomments-events.adoc[]

=== CommentChange event

include::partial$misc/admon-requires-6.1v.adoc[]

Fired when a comment is added, resolved, deleted, edited, or replied to. Contains the `getEventLog` API for retrieving log of comment changes.

==== Example: The CommentChange event

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',
  plugins: 'tinycomments',
  toolbar: 'addcomment showcomments',
  init_instance_callback: (editor) => {
    editor.on('CommentChange', (evt) => {
      console.log(evt.getEventLog());
    });
  }
});
----

== APIs

The {pluginname} plugin provides the following API.

[[getEventLog]]
=== getEventLog()

include::partial$misc/admon-requires-6.1v.adoc[]

Returns a log with information and timestamps of all changes to comments, including when:

* A new comment is added (and who added it).
* A comment is edited (and who edited it).
* A reply to a comment is added (and who added the reply).
* A comment is resolved (and who resolved the comment).
* A comment is deleted (and who deleted the comment).

The event log can be retrieved either in full or with the `after` option, which restricts the returned list to Comment events after a time-stamp date in the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601[ISO-8601] format, both shown in the following:

==== Example: Using `+getEventLog()+`

[source,js]
----
const comments = tinymce.activeEditor.plugins.tinycomments;

console.log(comments.getEventLog());
console.log(comments.getEventLog(
  { after: '2022-02-22T12:34:56Z' }  // ISO-8601 standard: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ
));

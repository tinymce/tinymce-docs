== API

The Comments plugin exposes the API `editor.plugins.tinycomments.getEventLog()` which returns a log of all `CommentChange` events. These events are dispatched whenever:

* A new comment is added (and who added it).
* A comment is edited (and who edited it).
* A reply to a comment is added (and who added the reply).
* A comment is resolved (and who resolved the comment).
* A comment is deleted (and who deleted the comment).

:minimumversion: 6.1

The event log can be retrieved either in full or with the `after` option, which restricts the returned list to Comment events after a time-stamp date in the link:https://www.iso.org/standard/70907.html[ISO-8601] format, both shown in the following:

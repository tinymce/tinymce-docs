The Comments plugin exposes an API, `editor.plugins.tinycomments.getEventLog()`, which returns a log of all `CommentChange` events which are fired when:

* A new comment is added (and who added it).
* A comment is edited (and who edited it).
* A reply to a comment is added (and who added the reply).
* A comment is resolved (and who resolved the comment).
* A comment is deleted (and who deleted the comment).

The event log can be retrieved either in full or with the `after` option, which restricts the returned list to Comment events after the time-stamp date, both shown in the following:

== Using the Comments plugin with the Mentions plugin

The Comments plugin can be used with the Mentions plugin to allow users to mention other users in comments.

When a user starts typing a mention with the `+@+` symbol, the mention dropdown will appear. Users can keep typing to narrow the search results, and either click on the desired user or navigate using arrow keys and press enter to add a mention to the comment.

When the comment is saved, mentioned users will appear in the comment text in the same way as they do in the editor.

All mentions are stored in the comment text as plain text, so for the mentions to be displayed correctly, the Mentions plugin must be included in the TinyMCE configuration when the comments are displayed.

To add mentions to comments, both the Comments and Mentions plugins must be included in the TinyMCE configuration, and all required options must be set.

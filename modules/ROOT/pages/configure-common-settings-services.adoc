= Common server-side component settings

:navtitle: Optional common settings
:description: Settings that affect all premium server-side components.

The following settings for the premium server-side components are optional and will apply to all services using the configuration file. These settings should be added to the `+application.conf+` file described in xref:configure-required-services.adoc[Required configuration for the server-side components].

[[proxy]]
== `+proxy+` (optional)

This element configures use of an HTTP proxy for outgoing HTTP/HTTPS requests made by the server-side components.

Default proxy settings are picked up from JVM system properties, usually provided on the command line, as defined in http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/doc-files/net-properties.html[Networking Properties for Java]. The system properties `+http.proxyHost+`, `+http.proxyPort+`, `+http.nonProxyHosts+`, `+https.proxyHost+`, `+https.proxyPort+` are recognized as well as `+http.proxyUser+` and `+http.proxyPassword+` to support authenticating proxies.

This optional proxy element provides an alternative to providing proxy settings as JVM system properties, or to override system properties.

|===
|Type |Setting |Description
|*element* |`+proxy+` |Stores HTTP outgoing proxy settings for the server-side components.
|*attribute* |`+http.proxyHost+` |A string defining the host name of the proxy for plain HTTP (not HTTPS) connections. (Mandatory)
|*attribute* |`+http.proxyPort+` |An integer defining the port number of the proxy for plain HTTP (not HTTPS) connections. (Mandatory)
|*attribute* |`+http.nonProxyHosts+` |A list of strings separated by vertical lines ("\|") listing hosts and domains to be excluded from proxying, for *both* plain HTTP and HTTPS connections. The strings can contain asterisks ("\*") as wildcards. (Optional, defaults to "localhost\|127.*\|[::1]" if not set.)
|*attribute* |`+https.proxyHost+` |A string defining the host name of the proxy for HTTPS connections. (Optional)
|*attribute* |`+https.proxyPort+` |An integer defining the port number of the proxy for HTTPS connections. (Optional)
|*attribute* |`+http.proxyUser+` |Username for authenticating to *both* the HTTP and HTTPS proxy. (Optional)
|*attribute* |`+http.proxyPassword+` |Password for authenticating to *both* the HTTP and HTTPS proxy. (Optional)
|===

In the following example, both HTTP and HTTPS connections (except to localhost and the example.com domain) are proxied through someproxy.example.com on port 8080 and someproxy.example.com does not require authentication.

[source,properties]
----
ephox {
  proxy {
    http.proxyHost = "someproxy.example.com"
    http.proxyPort = "8080"
    https.proxyHost = "someproxy.example.com"
    https.proxyPort = "8080"
    http.nonProxyHosts = "localhost|*.example.com"
  }
}
----

[[http]]
== `+http+` (optional)

Some server-side components make outbound HTTP and HTTPS connections. These include Link Checker, Enhanced Media Embed and Edit Image Proxy. In an evaluation or pre-production environment, you might want to test these features against resources with untrusted SSL certificates such as in-house servers with self-signed SSL certificates. In these circumstances, it is possible to bypass all SSL security.

This is not recommended for production environments.

[cols="^1,2,3",options="header"]
|===
|Type |Setting |Description
|*element* |`+http+` |Configures HTTP client behavior.
|*attribute* |`+trust-all-cert+` |A boolean indicating whether to bypass SSL security and indiscriminately trusts all SSL certificates. Default: false
|*attribute* |`+request-timeout-seconds+` |An integer defining the number of seconds to allow HTTP requests to take. Default: 10
|===

Example:

[source,properties]
----
ephox {
  http {
    trust-all-cert = true
  }
}
----

The request timeout on outbound HTTP and HTTPS connections can be set. Setting this to a larger value will allow larger files through, but they may take a long time. An example might be if you expect to fetch very large files with the image proxy service.

Example:

[source,properties]
----
ephox {
  http {
    request-timeout-seconds = 15
  }
}
----

=== Alternative http timeout settings

When greater control over timeout settings is needed, the following three settings can be used instead of the `+request-timeout-seconds+` setting:

* `+connection-request-timeout-seconds+`: The amount of time to wait for a connection from the connection pool.
* `+connect-timeout-seconds+`: The amount of time to wait for a connection to be established.
* `+socket-timeout-seconds+`: The amount of time to wait in between packets after a connection is established.

If one of these settings are required, remove `+request-timeout-seconds+` and specify values for all three of these settings.

For example:

[source,properties]
----
ephox {
  http {
    connection-request-timeout-seconds = 10
    connect-timeout-seconds = 5
    socket-timeout-seconds = 4
  }
}
----

= Required configuration for the server-side components
:navtitle: Required configuration
:description: Configuration options for premium server-side components.

== Creating a configuration file

NOTE: Use a plain text editor (such as gedit, vim, emacs, or notepad) when creating or editing the `+application.conf+` file. Do not use word processors like Microsoft Word or Evernote as these can insert extra characters which make the file unreadable to the server-side components.

The {productname} server-side components require a configuration file to function correctly. By convention, this file is named `+application.conf+`.

This configuration file will require you to enter _at least_ the following information:

* `+allowed-origins+` - the domains allowed to communicate with the server-side editor features. This is required by all server-side components.

The Enhanced Media Embed server-side component require additional configuration, which can be found on the xref:mediaembed-server-config.adoc[Enhanced Media Embed page].

[[allowed-origins]]
== `+allowed-origins+` (required)

{productname} editor instances make use of the server-side components by performing a cross-origin HTTP request. These requests are subject to a form of HTTP access control called Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). CORS is built into web browsers and is not a feature of {productname}'s server side components. A detailed explanation of CORS can be found on the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS[Mozilla Developer Network].

The `+allowed-origins+` element configures a list of *all* values that can be expected by the server-side components in a HTTP Origin header from your {productname} instances (see the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin[Mozilla Developer Network] for more information on the HTTP Origin header). In short, you'll need to supply a list of all the URLs that your {productname} instances will be served from without the path information.

IMPORTANT: When the services are matching against the `+allowed-origins+` list, the `+scheme+` (e.g. http) and the `+port+` (e.g. 800) are *ignored* by default. Customize this using xref:allowed-origins-ignore-port[`+ephox.allowed-origins.ignore-port+`] option.

This is best illustrated with some examples:

If users load {productname} from the following URLs:

* `+http://server.example.com/editor.php+`
* `+http://server.example.com/subpage/editor.php+`

Add `+server.example.com+` to the `+allowed-origins+` list.

If users load {productname} from the following URLs:

* `+https://server.example.com/editor.php+`
* `+http://server.example.com/subpage/editor.php+`

Add `+server.example.com+` to the `+allowed-origins+` list because the scheme is ignored.

If users load {productname} from the following URLs:

* `+https://server.example.com/editor.php+`
* `+https://server.example.com/+`

Add `+server.example.com+` to the `+allowed-origins+` list.

If users load {productname} from the following URLs:

* `+http://oneserver.example.com/editor.php+`
* `+http://twoserver.example.com/subpage/editor.php+`

Add `+oneserver.example.com+` and `+twoserver.example.com+` to the`+allowed-origins+` list.

If users load {productname} from the following URLs:

* `+http://server.example.com:8080/editor.php+`

Add `+server.example.com+` to the `+allowed-origins+` list because the port is ignored.

If users load {productname} from the following URLs:

* `+https://server.example.com:9000/editor.php+`

Add `+server.example.com+` to the `+allowed-origins+` list because the scheme and the port are ignored.

[cols="^1,1,3",options="header"]
|===
|Type |Setting |Description
|*element* |`+allowed-origins+` |Stores CORS setup information
|*attribute* |`+origins+` |An array of strings containing all possible values of the HTTP Origin header the server-side components can expect.
|===

Example:

[source,properties]
----
ephox {
  allowed-origins {
    origins = [ "myserver", "myserver.example.com", "myotherserver", "mysecureserver" ]
  }
}
----

[[wildcard-support]]
=== Wildcard support

The `+*+` wildcard character matches any value. Wildcards are supported in the following parts of entries in the `+allowed-origin+` list:

. As a prefix of the domain (e.g. `+*.example.com+`).
. As the only character (e.g. `+*+`). This will allow *any* Origin to access the server-side components.

NOTE: Option 2 allows a broad set of origins access to the server-side components and is NOT recommended for production deployments.

[source,properties]
----
ephox {
  allowed-origins {
    origins = [ "myserver", "*.mydomain.example.com" ]
  }
}
----

[[regular-expressions-support]]
=== Regular Expressions support

Regular expressions can be used alongside xref:wildcard-support[wildcards] for specifying `+allowed-origins.origins+`. To use a regular expression, start and end the expression with the forward-slash `+'/'+` character.

For example:

[source,properties]
----
ephox {
  allowed-origins {
    origins = [ "myserver", "/(myserver|myotherserver\.)?example\.com/" ]
  }
}
----

For a list of valid constructs, see: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#sum[Java 8: `+java.util.regex+` - Summary of regular-expression constructs].

[[allowed-originssame-origin]]
=== `+allowed-origins.same-origin+` (optional)

Enabling `+same-origin+` removes the need to specify the domain origin accessing the service if the service is deployed from the same server.

The `+allowed-origins+` `+same-origin+` option can be used to block all cross-origin requests. This option is set to `+false+` by default.

Setting the `+same-origin+` setting to `+true+` will block all HTTP `+OPTIONS+` requests and allow all other HTTP methods. When set to `+true+`, all `+origins+` specified in `+allowed-origins+` will be ignored.

For example:

[source,properties]
----
ephox {
  allowed-origins {
    same-origin: true
  }
}
----

[[allowed-origins-ignore-port]]
=== `+allowed-origins.ignore-port+` (optional)

To enforce a port check for the service's `+allowed-origins+`, set `+ignore-port+` to `+false+`. When `+ignore-port+` is set to false, all `+allowed-origins+` *must* include the port of the origin.

This option is set to `+true+` by default, so ports specified in `+allowed-origins+` are ignored.

For example:

[source,properties]
----
ephox {
  allowed-origins {
    origins = ["myserver:8000", "myserver:8001"]
    ignore-port = false
  }
}
----

== Troubleshooting Origins

If you missed an Origin or specified an Origin incorrectly, {productname} features that rely on the server-side components will not work from that Origin. If you observe that requests to the server-side components are failing or features are unavailable and you're not sure why, refer to the troubleshooting information about xref:troubleshoot-server.adoc#using-browser-tooling-to-investigate-services-issues[Using browser tooling to investigate services issues].

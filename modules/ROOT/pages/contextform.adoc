A context form consists of an input field, and a series of related buttons. Context forms can be shown wherever a context toolbar can be shown. Also, when a context form is registered containing a `+launch+` configuration, a special context toolbar button with name `+form:${name}+` is registered which will launch that particular context form. Context forms are a generalization of the `+Insert Link+` form that existed in the original link:https://www.tiny.cloud/docs-4x/themes/inlite/#quicklink[inlite] theme from TinyMCE 4.

== Registering a context form

A context form is registered by calling the `+addContextForm+` API in the registry. The specification of a context form is separated into two parts:

=== Launch

The button strings for launching a context form is `+form:${name}+` where name is the registered name of the context form (e.g. form:link).

NOTE: These buttons will only be present if the `+launch+` setting of the context form is specified.

The Launch specification. This relates to what the button that launches this form will look like.

[cols="1,4",options="header"]
|===
|Name |Details
|`+launch+` |This is the specification for the launching button that can appear in a context toolbar only. It will be either type: `+contextformbutton+` or `+contextformtogglebutton+`, and will be identical to those definitions below except it will *not* have an `+onAction+`.
|===

==== Launching context forms from a context toolbar

If a registered context form has a `+launch+` setting, then it can be launched from a context toolbar. The name of item will be `+form:${name}+` (e.g. 'form:link'). When the user presses this button, the toolbar will change into the specified context form. If you the user presses `+Esc+` in a context form that was launched through a context toolbar, they will be returned to the original context toolbar.

==== Launching a context form programmatically

There is an `+editor+` command, `+contexttoolbar-show+`, that can be dispatched to show a context form at the current selection. The command takes a parameter, `+toolbarKey+`, which specifies the name of the registered context form or context toolbar to show.

=== Form

This relates to the form itself. The form specifications are:

[cols="1,4",options="header"]
|===
|Name |Details
|`+launch+` |This is the specification for the launching button that can appear in a context toolbar only. It will be either type: `+contextformbutton+` or `+contextformtogglebutton+`, and will be identical to those definitions below except it will *not* have an `+onAction+`.
|`+label+` |This is the label that will appear in the form.
|`+initValue+` |This is the initial value the input will have in the form.
|`+predicate+` |This controls when the context toolbar will appear.
|`+position+` |This controls where the context toolbar will appear with regards to the current cursor.
|`+scope+` |This controls whether the predicate (condition) is a `+node+`-based predicate, or an `+editor+`-based predicate. See context toolbar priority for more details.
|`+commands+` |This is a list of the items to show in the context form. They can be either `+contextformbutton+` or `+contextformtogglebutton+`.
|`+onSetup+`

`+(ContextFormApi) => (ContextFormApi) => void+` 

Optional default: `+() => () => {}+` - Function that's  executed when the form is rendered. Once rendered, it returns a function that is executed when the context form is closed.

== Context form buttons

Unlike normal context toolbar buttons, Context form buttons are not registered beforehand. Instead, you need to define each button completely in the `+commands+` section.

=== Context form button

The definition of a context form button is very similar to the definition of a normal toolbar button. The main difference is that the action is slightly different (as it will relate to the form), and the type is `+contextformbutton+` instead of `+button+`. The following is the full list of options:

==== type: 'contextformbutton';

[cols="1,1,1,3",options="header"]
|===
|Name |Value |Requirement |Description
|primary |boolean |Optional |This will activate the button on <enter> in the input form.
|onAction |`+(formApi, togglebuttonApi) => void+` |Required |This decides what happens when the user clicks the button.
|active |boolean |Optional |default: `false`
|enabled |boolean |Optional |default: `true` - Represents button state. Is toggled by the button's API
|tooltip |string |Optional |Text for button tooltip.
|text |string |Optional |Text to display if no icon is found.
|icon |string |Optional |
include::partial$misc/admon-predefined-icons-only.adoc[]
|onSetup |`+(togglebuttonApi) => (togglebuttonApi) => void+` |Optional |default: `+() => () => {}+` - Function that's invoked when the button is rendered.
|===

Where the `+buttonApi+` is the same as a regular toolbar button and `+FormApi+` has `+(getValue: () => string, hide: () => void)+`

=== Context form toggle button

The context form toggle button is very similar to the a normal toolbar toggle button. The main difference is that the action is slightly different (as it will relate to the form), and the type is `+contextformtogglebutton+`, instead of `+togglebutton+`. The following is the full list of options:

==== type: 'contextformtogglebutton';

[cols="1,1,1,3",options="header"]
|===
|Name |Value |Requirement |Description
|primary |boolean |Optional |This will activate the button on <enter> in the input form.
|onAction |`+(formApi, togglebuttonApi) => void+` |Required |This decides what happens when the user clicks the button.
|active |boolean |Optional |default: `false`
|enabled |boolean |Optional |default: `true` - Represents button state. Is toggled by the button's API
|tooltip |string |Optional |Text for button tooltip.
|text |string |Optional |Text to display if no icon is found.
|icon |string |Optional |
include::partial$misc/admon-predefined-icons-only.adoc[]
|onSetup |`+(togglebuttonApi) => (togglebuttonApi) => void+` |Optional |default: `+() => () => {}+` - Function that's invoked when the button is rendered.
|===

Where the `+toggleButtonApi+` is the same as a regular toolbar toggle button.

=== formApi

Both `+contextformbutton+` and `+contextformtogglebutton+` are passed `+formApi+` in their `+onAction+` callback. The `+formApi+` has three functions:

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
|Functions |Description
|`+hide+` |This will hide the form. By default, no button hides the form. It is the responsibility of the developer to hide the form in the `+onAction+` handler of buttons that require that the context form close after the action.
|`+back+` |This will restore the previous toolbar. This is useful when you want to go back to the previous toolbar when you press back in the toolbar.
|`+getValue+` |This will retrieve the value current typed in the input field.
|===

== Example configuration

This example shows how the link plugin adds the standard link context form. The context form will show whenever any content is selected.

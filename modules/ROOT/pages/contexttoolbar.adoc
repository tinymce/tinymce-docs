A context toolbar can only contain either buttons that are defined for a normal toolbar, or buttons specifically registered for launching a xref:contextform.adoc[ContextForm]. The buttons comes as a list of strings, where each string is a registered name of a button.

== Registering a context toolbar

A context toolbar is registered by calling the `+addContextToolbar+` API in the registry. The specification is as follows:

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
|Name |Description
|`+predicate+` |This controls when the context toolbar will appear
|`+position+` |This controls where the context toolbar will appear with regards to the current cursor
|`+scope+` |This controls whether the predicate (condition) is a `+node+`-based predicate, or an `+editor+`-based predicate. See context toolbar priority section below, for more details.
|`+items+` |A list of strings which represent either a registered toolbar button, or a registered context form launcher.
|===

== Example configuration

This example shows how the quickbars plugin adds the standard selection context toolbar and an example of a custom toolbar for image alignment. The context toolbar will show whenever any content is selected.

== Launching a context toolbar programmatically

There is an `+editor+` event called `+contexttoolbar-show+` that can be fired to show a context toolbar at the current selection. The event takes a parameter `+toolbarKey+` which specifies the name of the registered context form or context toolbar to show.

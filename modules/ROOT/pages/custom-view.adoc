:keywords: view, UI, addView

{productname} allows developers to create custom views and attach them to the main editor view. This feature enables the creation of additional UI components that can be toggled on or off. When toggled on, the custom view replaces the editor, providing a distinct visual space for specialized functionality.

== Editor View API

The `addView` API in the editor's UI registry allows developers to register new view containers. These containers are initially hidden (off) and attached next to the main view. The visibility of these custom views can be toggled using the `ToggleView` command. The state of the custom view can be queried using the `queryCommandValue` method.

This is the syntax for the `addView` function: `+editor.ui.registry.addView(name: String, obj: View.ViewSpec)+`

=== Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description

| `+name+` | `+String+` | The `+name+` parameter is a unique identifier for the new view.

| `+obj+` | `+View.ViewSpec+` | The `+obj+` parameter is the view specification object.

=== Toggling the Custom View

To toggle the custom view, you can use the `+ToggleView+` command. Here is an example of how to use it:

[source,js]
----
// Assuming 'myCustomView' is the name of your custom view
editor.execCommand('ToggleView', false, 'myCustomView');
----

=== Querying the State of the Custom View

To query the state of the custom view (whether it is currently visible or hidden), you can use the `+queryCommandValue+` method:

[source,js]
----
// Assuming 'myCustomView' is the name of your custom view
editor.queryCommandValue('ToggleView') == 'myCustomView';
----

== Interactive example

This example shows how to integrate a custom view using the `addView` API.

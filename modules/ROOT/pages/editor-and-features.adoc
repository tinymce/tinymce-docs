{cloudname} is the easiest way to integrate {productname} and upgrade to premium plugins.

{cloudname} can be used without an API key. Refer to the xref:general-configuration-guide.adoc[Introduction & getting started] guide for more information. Sign up for an API key and update the script tag to use premium plugins or avoid the in-editor developer warning.

All {cloudname} accounts include a free, pre-configured {cloudname} image proxy service. This setup uses the xref:imagetools.adoc[Image tools] plugin.

== Integrating TinyMCE for the first time

=== Step 1: Insert the Tiny Cloud script tag into the webpage

Insert the {productname} editor code into the application to load {productname} for the first time. The code inserting is done by adding the following script tag into your app, or in the case of a web page the `<head>` of the page:

The following example adds a script tag into the application that inserts the code. Use the `<head>` of the page on a web page. Be sure to substitute 'no-api-key' with your api key.

[source, html, subs="attributes+"]
----
<script src="{cdnurl}" referrerpolicy="origin"></script>
----

|===
|  | Value | Description

| 1
| no-api-key
| Replace with your api key

| 2
| origin=
| A `referrerpolicy` specifies how much of the current page's URL is sent in the `Referer` header when the browser fetches page resources (for example, the {productname} editor). The use of the `Referer` header ensures API keys are only used on domains registered to their owners. We only care about the domain portion however (similar to the operation of `Origin` header), so for improved performance and privacy always set the `referrerpolicy` to `origin` when requesting {cloudname} resources.

[IMPORTANT, id="referer-troubleshooting"]
====
{cloudname} verifies the domain {productname} is loading from by checking the *Referer* header in the network request. Sometimes the domains in the *Referer* header does not match with the URL in the browser's address bar.

To check the *Referer* header, open your browser's _Developer's Tools_ and open the _Network_ tab. From there, find the request being made to load {productname} with your API key, and click on the *Headers* tab.  In the section called *Request Headers* there should be a field for *Referer*. If the value there is different from one of your registered URLs, you may need to adjust either your registered URLs, or your application's *Refer* header settings.

=== Step 2: Load, customize and interact with TinyMCE

There are more than 40 open source plugins that enhance the editing experience in addition to the advanced content create solutions on {cloudname}. A range of xref:basic-example.adoc[simple examples] are available. Refer to the xref:quick-start.adoc[Quick start] section for more information.

=== Step 3: Specifying purchased TinyMCE plugins and toolbar/menu items

Extend the xref:configure.adoc[{productname} configuration] to include any additional purchased plugins and associated toolbar and menu items. Refer to the following enablement guides for more information:

* xref:premium-mentions.adoc[Mentions]
* xref:premium-tinydrive.adoc[{cloudfilemanager}]
* xref:comments.adoc[Comments]
* xref:premium-pageembed.adoc[Page Embed]
* xref:premium-permanentpen.adoc[Permanent Pen]
* xref:premium-formatpainter.adoc[Format Painter]
* xref:premium-powerpaste.adoc[PowerPaste]
* xref:premium-tinymcespellchecker.adoc[Spell Checker Pro]

NOTE: `spellchecker_rpc_url` is *not* required when enabling this plugin via xref:cloud-deployment-guide.adoc[{cloudname}].

* xref:imagetools.adoc[Image Tools (with configured image proxy)]

NOTE: Configuration of the `imagetools_cors_hosts` and `imagetools_proxy` properties occurs automatically.

* xref:premium-moxiemanager.adoc[Moxie Manager]
* xref:premium-a11ychecker.adoc[Accessibility Checker]
* xref:premium-advcode.adoc[Advanced Code Editor]
* xref:premium-mediaembed.adoc[Enhanced Media Embed]
* xref:premium-linkchecker.adoc[Link Checker]

NOTE: It may take up to 30 minutes for the purchased plugin to be available to {productname}. Clear the browser's cache.

=== Step 4: Forward proxy configuration

Ensure that the following URLs are accessible via this proxy if the network has a forward proxy that controls access to the internet.

* All URLs where the editor is deployed.
* All URLs where the plugins are deployed.
* \https://imageproxy.tiny.cloud
* \https://hyperlinking.tiny.cloud
* \https://spelling.tiny.cloud

Ensure the `tiny-api-key` and `tinymce-api-key` headers are retained while requesting the list of above URLs.

=== Step 5: Specifying a translation

To change the user interface language with a language pack, use the xref:configure-localization.adoc#language[language configuration option].

Alternatively, link:{gettiny}/language-packages/[download a language pack] to enable a language other than English (US). xref:configure-localization.adoc#language_url[Specify its location] with the `language_url` configuration option.

== Migrating from a self-hosted environment to Tiny Cloud

=== Step 1: Replace existing reference to tinymce.min.js

Migrating from a self-hosted environment to {cloudname} is easy. Remove the existing script tag that loads {productname}`'s JavaScript.

NOTE: The script tag typically references `tinymce.min.js` hosted within the application or available at a legacy CDN.

Replace the script tag with the following:

[source, html, subs="attributes+"]
----
<script src="{cdnurl}" referrerpolicy="origin"></script>
----

=== Step 2: Update custom plugin paths

Reference xref:integration-and-setup.adoc#external_plugins[external_plugins] to ensure custom plugins or modified plugins continue to function in the {cloudname} deployment.

WARNING: Do not use the regular xref:work-with-plugins.adoc[plugins] configuration element.

=== Step 3: Specify purchased TinyMCE plugins and toolbar buttons

Extend the xref:configure.adoc[{productname} configuration] to include any additional purchased plugins and associated toolbar and menu items. Refer to the following enablement guides for more information:

* xref:premium-mentions.adoc[Mentions]
* xref:premium-tinydrive.adoc[{cloudfilemanager}]
* xref:comments.adoc[Comments]
* xref:premium-pageembed.adoc[Page Embed]
* xref:premium-permanentpen.adoc[Permanent Pen]
* xref:premium-formatpainter.adoc[Format Painter]
* xref:premium-powerpaste.adoc[Powerpaste]
* xref:premium-tinymcespellchecker.adoc[Spell Checker Pro]

NOTE: `spellchecker_rpc_url` is *not* required when enabling this plugin via xref:cloud-deployment-guide.adoc[{cloudname}].

* xref:imagetools.adoc[Image tools (with configured image proxy)]

NOTE: Configuration of the `imagetools_cors_hosts` and `imagetools_proxy` properties occurs automatically.

* xref:premium-moxiemanager.adoc[Moxie Manager]
* xref:premium-a11ychecker.adoc[Accessibility Checker]
* xref:premium-advcode.adoc[Advanced Code Editor]
* xref:premium-mediaembed.adoc[Enhanced Media Embed]

{cloudname} is the easiest way to integrate {productname} and upgrade to premium plugins.

{cloudname} can be used without an API key. Sign up for an API key and update the script tag to use premium plugins or avoid the in-editor developer warning.

All {cloudname} accounts include a free, pre-configured {cloudname} image proxy service. This setup uses the xref:editimage.adoc[Enhanced Image Editing] plugin.

== Integrating {productname} for the first time

=== Step 1: Insert the Tiny Cloud script tag into the webpage

Insert the {productname} editor code into the application to load {productname} for the first time. The code inserting is done by adding the following script tag into your app, or in the case of a web page the `+<head>+` of the page:

The following example adds a script tag into the application that inserts the code. Use the `+<head>+` of the page on a web page. Be sure to substitute 'no-api-key' with your api key.

[source,html,subs="attributes+"]
----
<script src="{cdnurl}" referrerpolicy="origin"></script>
----

[cols="1,2,12",options="header"]
|===
| |Value |Description
|1 |no-api-key |Replace with your api key
|2 |origin |A `+referrerpolicy+` specifies how much of the current page's URL is sent in the `+Referer+` header when the browser fetches page resources (for example, the {productname} editor). The use of the `+Referer+` header ensures API keys are only used on domains registered to their owners. We only care about the domain portion however (similar to the operation of `+Origin+` header), so for improved performance and privacy always set the `+referrerpolicy+` to `+origin+` when requesting {cloudname} resources.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{cloudname} verifies the domain {productname} is loading from by checking the *Referer* header in the network request. Sometimes the domains in the *Referer* header does not match with the URL in the browser's address bar.

To check the *Referer* header, open your browser's _Developer's Tools_ and open the _Network_ tab. From there, find the request being made to load {productname} with your API key, and click on the *Headers* tab. In the section called *Request Headers* there should be a field for *Referer*. If the value there is different from one of your registered URLs, you may need to adjust either your registered URLs, or your application's *Refer* header settings.

=== Step 2: Load, customize and interact with {productname}

There are more than 40 open source plugins that enhance the editing experience in addition to the advanced content create solutions on {cloudname}. A range of xref:basic-example.adoc[simple examples] are available. Refer to the xref:cloud-quick-start.adoc[Quick start] section for more information.

=== Step 3: Specifying purchased {productname} plugins and toolbar/menu items

NOTE: It may take up to 30 minutes for the purchased plugin to be available to {productname}. Clear the browser’s cache.

Extend the xref:basic-setup.adoc[{productname} configuration] to include any additional purchased plugins and associated toolbar and menu items. Refer to the following enablement guides for more information:

include::partial$misc/premium-plugin-list.adoc[]

include::partial$misc/admon-cloud-configured-options.adoc[]

=== Step 4: Forward proxy configuration

Ensure that the following URLs are accessible via this proxy if the network has a forward proxy that controls access to the internet.

* All URLs where the editor is deployed.
* All URLs where the plugins are deployed.
* +https://imageproxy.tiny.cloud+
* +https://hyperlinking.tiny.cloud+
* +https://spelling.tiny.cloud+

Ensure the `+tiny-api-key+` and `+tinymce-api-key+` headers are retained while requesting the list of above URLs.

=== Step 5: Specifying a translation

To change the user interface language with a language pack, use the xref:ui-localization.adoc#language[language configuration option].

Alternatively, xref:ui-localization.adoc#language_url[Specify its location] with the `+language_url+` configuration option.

== Migrating from a self-hosted environment to Tiny Cloud

=== Step 1: Replace existing reference to tinymce.min.js

Migrating from a self-hosted environment to {cloudname} is easy. Remove the existing script tag that loads {productname}’s JavaScript.

NOTE: The script tag typically references `+tinymce.min.js+` hosted within the application or available at a legacy CDN.

Replace the script tag with the following:

[source,html,subs="attributes+"]
----
<script src="{cdnurl}" referrerpolicy="origin"></script>
----

=== Step 2: Update custom plugin paths

Reference xref:editor-important-options.adoc#external_plugins[external_plugins] to ensure custom plugins or modified plugins continue to function in the {cloudname} deployment.

WARNING: Do not use the regular xref:work-with-plugins.adoc[plugins] configuration element.

=== Step 3: Specify purchased {productname} plugins and toolbar buttons

Extend the xref:basic-setup.adoc[{productname} configuration] to include any additional purchased plugins and associated toolbar and menu items. Refer to the following enablement guides for more information:

include::partial$misc/premium-plugin-list.adoc[]

include::partial$misc/admon-cloud-configured-options.adoc[]

{cloudfilemanager} is a premium {productname} plugin for cloud-based asset management and storage solution. {cloudfilemanager} is a solution for creating rich text by attaching and embedding images, videos, and other files in your document.

{cloudfilemanager} presents a cloud-based asset management and storage solution that provides the ease of use of Google Drive without the server requirements of a self-hosted asset manager such as our own MoxieManager.

== Configuring the editor for Tiny Drive

Once you have the API key, or if you are a current {cloudname} user who already has an API key, then you have access to {cloudfilemanager}. In order to get the service up and running, you'll need to complete a few more steps. See our xref:tinydrive.adoc[documentation] for more information.

== Security & performance

We know security is a primary concern when it comes to cloud storage.  {cloudfilemanager} uses an https://aws.amazon.com/s3/[Amazon Web Services S3] bucket, the same storage solution used by companies like Netflix, Thomson Reuters, and Zillow.  (You can read about Amazon's comprehensive security approach https://aws.amazon.com/security/[here].)

As your assets are passed back and forth between your {productname} editor instance and the S3 bucket, {cloudfilemanager} uses both your API key and a https://jwt.io/introduction/[JSON Web Token] (JWT) to authenticate each data transaction.  Each {cloudfilemanager} user will need to create their own JWT, and we walk you through the whole process xref:tinydrive-jwt-authentication.adoc[here].

And to make sure your assets are delivered as fast as possible, we utilize the https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/[CloudFront CDN], which is Amazon's global content delivery network, known for its low latency and high data transfer speeds.

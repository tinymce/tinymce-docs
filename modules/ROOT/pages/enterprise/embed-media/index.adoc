The link:{baseurl}/plugins/premium/mediaembed/[Enhanced Media Embed plugin] makes it easy to add an enhanced content creation experience in your website or app with enriched media previews from the most popular web sources. Facebook, YouTube, Flickr, NY Times, Vimeo, Hulu, Tumblr, CodePen, SlideShare, TechCrunch, WordPress, Twitch, Spotify ... and many more!

By easy, we mean easy. The service automatically "`looks behind the link`" to see whether a URL in the {productname} editor points to a rich media source. That URL will resolve into an enhanced media thumbnail whenever possible.

It is now as simple as adding a plugin to deliver a modern, content creation experience that everyone takes for granted.

Your have two deployment options. One is super easy with {cloudname}, the other is to go the more traditional Self-hosted route, requiring an additional link:{baseurl}/enterprise/server/[server-side component] to be installed and configured.

== Enhanced Media Embed self-hosted setup

Once you have the link:{baseurl}/enterprise/server/[server-side component] installed, additional configuration to your `application.conf` file is required. (Don't forget to restart the Java application server after updating the configuration.)

You also need to link:{baseurl}/enterprise/embed-media/mediaembed-server-integration/[integrate] and link:{baseurl}/enterprise/embed-media/mediaembed-server-config/[configure] the Enhanced Media Embed server.

== Enhanced Media Embed cloud setup

link:{baseurl}/cloud-deployment-guide/editor-and-features/[{cloudname}] makes setting up Enhanced Media Embed a breeze. Simply include the `mediaembed` parameter in your `tinymce.init` and have the {cloudname} services do the work for you.

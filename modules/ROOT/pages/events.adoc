[[handling-editor-events]]
== Handling Editor events

{productname} supports several types of events for working with the editor and plugins.

* xref:browser-native-events[Supported browser-native events]
* xref:editor-core-events[Editor core events]
* xref:plugin-events[Plugin events]
* xref:editor-manager-events[Editor Manager events]

The following examples illustrate how to use supported native events, editor core events, and plugin events with {productname}. Editor Manager events are handled separately using `+tinymce.on+`, rather than `+editor.on+`.

=== Defining an event handler

Event handlers can be initialized anywhere using the `+editor.on+` method, as shown in the following example:

[source,js]
----
tinymce.activeEditor.on('click', (e) => {
  console.log('Editor was clicked at: ' + e.pageX + ', ' + e.pageY);
});
----

=== `+setup+` and `+init_instance_callback+` options

A common use case for setting up events is to use the `+setup+` and `+init_instance_callback+` options. These options allow you to bind events before and after the editor instance is initialized.

The `+setup+` option can be used to bind an event **before** the editor instance is initialized.

The `+init_instance_callback+` option can be used to bind an event **after** the editor instance is initialized.

TIP: The `+init_instance_callback+` is functionally equivalent to binding an event listener to the `init` event on the `+setup+` option.

For example, the following code:

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',
  setup: (editor) => {
    editor.on('init', (e) => {
      console.log('Editor is initialized.');
    });
  }
});
----

Is equivalent to:

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',
  init_instance_callback: (editor) => {
    console.log('Editor is initialized.');
  }
});
----

For more information on these options, see xref:editor-important-options.adoc#setup[setup] and xref:editor-important-options.adoc#init_instance_callback[init_instance_callback].

=== Binding an event before editor initialization

The following example uses the `+setup+` option to bind an event before the editor instance is initialized. This is an example of handling an event that does not return data, such as the `+ResizeEditor+` editor event. Therefore, the `+e+` parameter is not used.

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',
  setup: (editor) => {
    editor.on('ResizeEditor', (e) => {
      console.log('Editor was resized.');
    });
  }
});
----

=== Binding an event after editor initialization

The following example uses the `+init_instance_callback+` option to bind an event after the editor instance is initialized. This is an example of handling an event that returns data, such as the `+ExecCommand+` event. Therefore, we can use the `+e+` parameter to access the data returned by the event.

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',
  init_instance_callback: (editor) => {
    editor.on('ExecCommand', (e) => {
      console.log(`The ${e.command} command was fired.`);
    });
  }
});
----

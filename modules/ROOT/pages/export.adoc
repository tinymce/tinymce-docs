== Cloud Installation

The {pluginname} plugin is provided with all subscriptions to xref:editor-and-features.adoc[{cloudname}], including an automatically configured image proxy. To add the {pluginname} plugin to the editor, add `{plugincode}` to the `+plugins+` option in the editor configuration.

=== Basic setup using Tiny Cloud

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  plugins: 'export',
  toolbar: 'export'
});
----

== Self-hosted Installation

To add the {pluginname} plugin to the editor:

. Add `{plugincode}` to the `+plugins+` option in the editor configuration.
. Enable the xref:export_image_proxy[`+export_image_proxy+`] or xref:export_image_proxy_service_url[`+export_image_proxy_service_url+`] options as required.

=== Basic self-hosted setup

[source,js]
----

  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML

== Exporters

The {pluginname} plugin provides the following exporters:

* xref:client-side-pdf[Client-side PDF (`+clientpdf+`)]

[[client-side-pdf]]
=== Client-side PDF (`+clientpdf+`)

The client-side PDF exporter converts the editor content to a PDF without the need for server-side components. This exporter will resize the content to fit on A4 pages, add page breaks, take a snapshot of the HTML, and embed the snapshot image within the exported PDF.

This exporter has a few limitations or known issues that should be noted:

* The text content in the PDF cannot be selected or copied.
* A single line of content sliced horizontally and distributed across separate pages.
* Due to browser limitations, there is a limit on the number of pages that can be rendered. The number of pages varies between browsers.
* Remote images require an image proxy to render due to browser limitations. For information on proxying remote images, see the xref:export_image_proxy[export_image_proxy] or xref:export_image_proxy_service_url[export_image_proxy_service_url] options.
* Right-to-left languages that use cursive scripts (such as Arabic) may not render correctly due to an issue with how the image of the HTML content is rendered.

The following plugins are not supported:

* xref:introduction-to-tiny-comments.adoc[Comments]
* xref:introduction-to-mediaembed.adoc[Enhanced Media Embed]

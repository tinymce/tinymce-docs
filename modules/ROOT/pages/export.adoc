The {pluginname} plugin adds the ability to export content from the editor to a user's local machine in various formats. For a list of available exporters and information on what they support, see the xref:exporters[Exporters section].

== Interactive example

To export the editor content, either:

* From the _File_ menu, click _Export_ and select _PDF_.
* Click the Export toolbar button (image:icons/export.svg[Export icon: A page with an arrow from the center of the page to the right of the page]) and select _PDF_.

== Basic setup

To add the {pluginname} plugin to the editor, add `{plugincode}` to the `+plugins+` option in the editor configuration.

For example:

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  plugins: 'export',
  toolbar: 'export',
  export_image_proxy: 'proxy.php' // Required for rendering remote images
});
----

== Exporters

The {pluginname} plugin provides the following exporters:

* xref:client-side-pdf[Client-side PDF (`+clientpdf+`)]

[[client-side-pdf]]
=== Client-side PDF (`+clientpdf+`)

The client-side PDF exporter converts the editor content to a PDF without the need for server-side components. This exporter will resize the content to fit on A4 pages, add page breaks, take a snapshot of the HTML, and embed the snapshot image within the exported PDF.

This exporter has a few limitations or known issues that should be noted:

* The text content in the PDF cannot be selected or copied.
* A single line of content sliced horizontally and distributed across separate pages.
* Due to browser limitations, there is a limit on the number of pages that can be rendered. The number of pages varies between browsers.
* Remote images require an image proxy to render due to browser limitations. For information on proxying remote images, see the xref:export_image_proxy[export_image_proxy] option.
* Right-to-left languages that use cursive scripts (such as Arabic) may not render correctly due to an issue with how the image of the HTML content is rendered.
* The xref:checklist.adoc[Checklist plugin] icons will not render for Internet Explorer 11 users due to browser limitations.

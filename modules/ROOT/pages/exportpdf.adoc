The {pluginname} feature collects the HTML generated with the `tinymce.editor.getContent()` method and combines it with the default editor content styles along with the styles provided in the plugin configuration. The combined content and styles are then processed by the included server-side converter service, which can be either self-hosted or cloud-based. Following this processing, a PDF file is generated, which is subsequently returned to the userâ€™s browser, enabling them to save it onto their disk or drive.

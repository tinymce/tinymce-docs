The export to Microsoft Word feature collects the HTML generated with the `tinymce.editor.getContent()` method and the default editor content styles combined with the styles provided by you in the configuration. It then sends them to the {productname} Cloud Services HTML to DOCX converter service. The service generates a Word file and returns it to the userâ€™s browser so they can save it in the Word format on their disk.

[NOTE]
The generated `.docx` file may not be fully compatible with older versions of Word.

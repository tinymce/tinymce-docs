The export to Microsoft Word feature collects the HTML generated with the `tinymce.editor.getContent()` method and combines it with the default editor content styles along with the styles provided in the plugin configuration. The combined content and styles are then processed by the included server-side converter service, which can be either self-hosted or cloud-based. Following this processing, a Word file is generated, which is subsequently returned to the userâ€™s browser, enabling them to save it in the Word format onto their disk or drive.

[NOTE]
.{pluginname} known issues
====
* The generated `.docx` file may not be fully compatible with older versions of Word.
* xref:introduction-to-mediaembed.adoc[Enhanced Media Embed] will not be included in the exported document, resulting in a console.error _"The Export to Word plugin requires the `exportword_service_url` to be configured"_.
====

== Basic setup using the {companyname} Cloud service

To add the {pluginname} plugin to the editor, add `{plugincode}` to the `plugins` option in the editor configuration.

For example:

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',
  plugins: 'exportword',
  toolbar: 'exportword',
});
----

[IMPORTANT]
When using the {pluginname} plugin with the {companyname} Cloud service, JWT authentication is required to use the service. For more information on how to set up JWT authentication with {pluginname}, see examples:

* xref:export-to-word-with-jwt-authentication-nodejs.adoc[Export to Word with JWT authentication].
* xref:export-to-word-with-jwt-authentication-php.adoc[Export to Word with JWT authentication].

== Basic setup using the self-hosted service

To use the self-hosted version of the {pluginname} plugin, you need to set the `exportword_service_url` option to the URL of the service.

For example:
[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',
  plugins: 'exportword',
  toolbar: 'exportword',
  exportword_service_url: 'http://localhost:8080/' // Update with the URL of the service you are using such  as 'http://myserver.com/'
});
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `exportword_service_url` option automatically appends `/v2/convert/html-docx` to the URL provided, so only the base URL is required. For example, if the service is hosted at `http://localhost:8080/v2/convert/html-docx`, the `exportword_service_url` option should be set to `http://localhost:8080/`. When using in production, ensure that `exportword_service_url` is updated to the production URL such as `https://myserver.com/`.

The export to Microsoft Word feature collects the HTML generated with the `tinymce.editor.getContent()` method and combines it with the default editor content styles along with the styles provided in the configuration. The combined content and styles are then transmitted to the {productname} Cloud Services HTML to DOCX converter service. Following this, the service generates a Word file, which is subsequently returned to the userâ€™s browser, enabling them to save it in the Word format onto their disk.

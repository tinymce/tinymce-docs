The export to Microsoft Word feature collects the HTML generated with the `tinymce.editor.getContent()` method and combines it with the default editor content styles along with the styles provided in the plugin configuration. The combined content and styles are then processed by the included server-side converter service, which can be either self-hosted or cloud-based. Following this processing, a Word file is generated, which is subsequently returned to the user’s browser, enabling them to save it in the Word format onto their disk or drive.

====
* The generated `.docx` file may not be fully compatible with older versions of Word.

====

== Basic setup

To add the {pluginname} plugin to the editor, add `{plugincode}` to the `plugins` option in the editor configuration.

For example:

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',
  plugins: 'exportword',
  toolbar: 'exportword',
  exportword_service_url: 'http://localhost:8080/' // update to your own self-hosted service URL
});
----

[IMPORTANT]
The `exportword_service_url` option automatically appends `/v2/convert/html-docx` to the URL provided, so only the base URL is required. For example, if the service is hosted at `http://localhost:8080/v2/convert/html-docx`, the `exportword_service_url` option should be set to `http://localhost:8080/`.

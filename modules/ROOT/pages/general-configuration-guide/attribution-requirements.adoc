This page describes:

* When the use of {productname} needs to be attributed to {companyname}.
* How to attribute {productname} to {companyname}.

== Paid Customers

If you are using {productname} on a paid tier of {cloudname} or have an active commercial license agreement, you are not required to include attribution.

== Free and Open Source Users

// TODO: I think the link in the next line should be link:{legalpages}/attribution-requirements/[Terms of Service]
Users on a free tier of {cloudname} are *required* by the link:{legalpages}/tiny-cloud-services-subscription-agreement/[Terms of Service] to include attribution when {productname} is shown.

As per https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/blob/develop/LICENSE.TXT#L278[clause 6 of the LGPL 2.1], users using {productname} under the LGPL are required to give prominent notice that {productname} is in use. We recommend including attribution as described below.

== Including Attribution with TinyMCE

The {productname} status bar provides the required attribution on the right-hand side.

The following example shows the status bar product attribution in the bottom, right-hand corner:

If the status bar is removed or not visible on the editor, you can include attribution per the following:

* "*POWERED BY TINY*" or the link:{url}/guidelines/#logo[{companyname} logo] placed in a readily visible location in your application when the editor is loaded.
* The word "*Tiny*" or the {companyname} logo should have a hyperlink to link:{url}[{url}].

The location of the product attribution is to be:

* In the right-hand corner of the status bar of the {productname} editor; or
* An alternate location adjacent to the {productname} editor that is no less prominent.

= TinyMCE classic editing mode
:description: The Theme that renders iframe or inline modes using the TinyMCE core UI framework.
:keywords: theme classic
:title_nav: Classic editing mode

{productname} has three main integration modes:

* "classic" full editor mode
* inline editing mode
* distraction-free mode

There are a few important differences between these modes:

* Classic mode embeds an iframe in the page, which sandboxes the content and styles used in the content area.
* Inline mode does not use an iframe; the editor is run on the selected HTML element.
* The lack of sandboxing for the inline editor allows page scripts and styles to be used in the editor.
* Distraction-free mode is an inline editor with additional configuration to provide greater functionality.

*Classic* mode refers to the standard {productname} integration. Such as:

liveDemo::default[]

== Example: Replacing a textarea with the default editor

A basic TinyMCE editor can be added to a `textarea` element with the id `mytextarea` using:

[source, js]
----
tinymce.init({
    selector: 'textarea#mytextarea'
});
----

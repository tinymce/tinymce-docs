xref:mergetags.adoc[Merge Tags]

Allows the insertion of merge tags (also known as personalization tokens, or mail merge fields).

xref:content-behavior-options.adoc#editable_root[`editable_root`]

Sets the initial editable state of a TinyMCE instanceâ€™s root.

xref:content-behavior-options.adoc#editable_class[`editable_class`]

As is normal and long-time best practice, {productname} documents keep CSS and HTML separate. This practice is not, however, email-friendly.

The {pluginname} plugin takes a {productname} document, and processes it such that the previously separate CSS is applied inline to each HTML element. This single output file is much closer to the common requirements for sending as an HTML-formatted email.

== Interactive example

liveDemo::inline-css[]

== Basic setup

To add the {pluginname} plugin to the editor, add `{plugincode}` to the `plugins` option in the editor configuration.

For example:

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  plugins: 'inlinecss',
});
----

== Usage notes

The {pluginname} plugin does not support

. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes[Pseudo-classes] (for example `button:hover { color: blue; }`).
. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements[Pseudo-elements] (for example `p::first-line { color: blue; }`)
. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/At-rule[@ rules] (for example `@media (screen)`)
. The `!important` property.

=== Iframe mode is fully supported with some notable limitations

Since iframe is a sandbox, specifying CSS is reasonably constrained at this stage. 

CSS styling information can be specified in several places for iframe mode:

* A CSS stylesheet that is specified in the `<head>` of the iframe document i.e. `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`
** The supported way to add a stylesheet in {productname} is using the `content_css` option which automatically creates the `<link>` tag and puts it in the `<head>` of the document.
** The user can also manually insert a stylesheet link in the <head> of the `iframe`.
* A `<style>` tag in the `<head>` of the `iframe` document i.e. `<style>p { color: red; }</style>`
** The supported way to add a style tag in {productname}, is using the `content_style` option which automatically creates the `<style>` tag and puts in the head of the document
** The user can manually insert a style tag in the <head> of the `iframe`.
* A `style` attribute on an element within the content i.e. inline CSS

It is worth noting that by default, {productname} does not support having a `<style>` tags as part of the body HTML content.

=== Inline mode is supported with some notable limitations

As `inline` mode for {productname} editor is not sandboxed and as a result, any CSS specified on the main page can have an effect on how the editor content looks. 

CSS styling information can be specified in several places for inline mode:

* A CSS stylesheet that is specified in the `<head>` of the page i.e. `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`
** Adding a stylesheet in {productname}, can be done by using the `content_css` option which automatically creates the `<link>` tag in the <head> of the page.
*** It is recommended to not use the `content_css` option though and just **manually** include the stylesheets.
*** The user can also manually insert a stylesheet link in the <head> of the page.
* A CSS stylesheet that is specified in the `<body>` of the page i.e. `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`
** This is not recommended by https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link[MDN], but some browsers do allow it
* A `<style>` in the `<head>` of the page i.e. `<style>p { color: red; }</style>`
** To add a `<style>` in {productname} is by using the `content_style` option which automatically creates the `<style>` tag in the <head> of the document
** The user can also manually put a `<style>` tag in the <head> of the page.
* A `<style>` in the `<body>` of the page
** As noted in the `Classic iframe` section, this should not be done, but some browsers will still allow it.
* A `style` attribute on an {productname} element within the content i.e. inline CSS

=== Shadow DOM is supported but **not** officially, with some notable limitations

Shadow DOM is **not** officially supported by {productname}, but the feature will work when an editor running in `inline` or `iframe` is contained within a shadow root. 

When an `iframe` mode editor is contained with a shadow root, the editor content can be styled the same way, where the expected behavior for the `feature` is that it should not have to consider if the editor is in a shadow root. When an `inline` editor is contained within a shadow root, the stylesheet (`<link>` tags) and `<style>` tags are added directly as children of the shadow root and do not need to be contained within a `<head>` tag. 

When in `inline mode`, the feature checks if the editor is inside a shadow root to ensure it does not try to get `<styles>` that are outside the shadow root.

When an editor is in a shadow root, the feature should still support getting the stylesheets specified via the `content_css` option as well as the CSS styles specified via  the`content_style` option.

// This plugin allows extracting the content of the editor with CSS inlined.
// Support classic and inline modes. Can be used in shadow dom. 
// Should be able to extract CSS from the stylesheets defined via
// `content_css` and `font_css` options, and CSS styles defined via `style_css` option.


// There is only one API: `getContent()`.
// Regarding to the events, it dispatches `InlineCSS` event.
// I think it is OK to document this event even though its purpose isn’t really for the user’s usage.

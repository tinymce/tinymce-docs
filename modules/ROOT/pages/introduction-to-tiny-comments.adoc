== Getting started with the {pluginname} plugin - Selecting a mode

The {pluginname} plugin offers two modes:

=== Callback Mode

This default mode stores comments externally, such as in a database, and requires callback functions to manage comment data. For setup details, refer to: xref:comments-callback-mode.adoc[Configuring the {pluginname} plugin in Callback mode].

=== Embedded Mode

In this mode, comments are stored directly within the content, without needing callback configuration. For setup details, refer to: xref:comments-embedded-mode.adoc[Configuring the Comments plugin in Embedded mode].

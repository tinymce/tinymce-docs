[IMPORTANT]
====
**Starting in early 2024, all editors on our cloud platform will be required to have a valid API key.** Without a valid API key, **your editor will transition to read-only mode**, limiting your ability to make changes.

Affected users will receive a xref:cloud-troubleshooting.adoc#A-valid-API-key-is-required-starting-2024-to-continue-using-TinyMCE.-Please-alert-your-admin-to-sign-up-to-get-your-free-API-key.[notification in their editor]. If you receive this notification, please contact the Administrator for your application/site. Admins will need to https://www.tiny.cloud/my-account/integrate/[get a valid API key] and paste it into the code to continue using {productname}.
====

== How will I know if this change affects me?

If {productname} detects an invalid API key, it will display a notification. If you know or suspect you have been actively hiding or suppressing this notification, please remove these overrides. If you then see a notification, please follow the instructions to resolve the issue. If no notification appears, you are not affected. 

== How can I get an API key?

The Admin who owns your {productname} implementation will need to log in https://www.tiny.cloud/my-account/integrate/[here] to get your account’s API key. If you do not have an account yet, you can https://www.tiny.cloud/pricing/[sign up for a free API key]. Paid users can https://www.tiny.cloud/contact/[contact our Technical Support] team for help.

== What will happen if I don't provide a valid API key?

All editors on our cloud platform without a valid API key will be set to read-only mode in the beginning of 2024. If you self-host {productname}, you will not be impacted.

== Why is an API key required?
 
We require an API key for all {productname} editors on our cloud platform in order to maintain the quality of our service, ensure reliable security, and keep up with industry best practices. 

== If {productname} is free and open source, why is an API key required?

{productname} can be accessed through a variety of licensing and hosting methods, including both free and paid options. 

The free, open source option for {productname} is available under the _GNU General Public License Version 2 or later_. Users must self-host {productname} to take advantage of the open source license. **This type of license does not require an API key**.

The cloud hosted option for {productname} is available under commercial license, as described https://www.tiny.cloud/legal/cloud-use-subscription-agreement/[here]. **This type of license requires an active API key.**

If you are receiving an error notification, you are using the cloud-hosted option of {productname} under a commercial license. If you want to continue using {productname} without an API key, you will need to either migrate to the free, open source, self-hosted option or use a 3rd party-hosted CDN option under an MIT license. 

== I installed the npm package, which I assumed would be self-hosted. Why am I getting a notification that an API key is required? 

Our integrations default to using the {productname} Cloud service. If you’re receiving the notification that an API key is required, it means that you’re using the cloud-hosted option for {productname} under commercial license which requires a valid API key and allows for 1,000 editor loads per month for free. 

Please xref:installation.adoc[read our docs] to learn how to self-host {productname} or https://www.tiny.cloud/pricing/[sign up here] to continue using {productname} Cloud.

== I’ve used {productname} for years. Why am I now receiving notification that an API key is required? 

Thank you for your long-term use of {productname} and for selecting it for your projects. If you're suddenly receiving this notification, it means that previous versions of the notification were hidden within your {productname} editor. We are working to ensure that all active users of {productname} are aware of the API key requirement, including those that may have hidden these notifications in the past.

== What does the message "This domain is not registered with Tiny Cloud" mean?

This message means that the domain attempting to use {productname} is not registered with Tiny Cloud. Starting in 2024, a registered domain will be required to continue using {productname}.

== How can I resolve the issue of an unregistered domain?

To resolve this issue, please inform your administrator and request that they review the list of approved domains on your Tiny Account. If necessary, they will need to add the unregistered domain to the approved list. xref:cloud-troubleshooting.adoc#This-domain-is-not-registered-with-Tiny-Cloud.-To-continue-using-TinyMCE-a-registered-domain-is-required-starting-2024.-Please-alert-your-admin-to-review-the-approved-domains-and-add-this-one-if-required.[Learn more here].

== Where can I view the list of approved domains for my Tiny Cloud account?

You can view the list of approved domains by logging into https://www.tiny.cloud/my-account/domains/[your Tiny Account]. The approved domains are stored against your API Key.

== I would prefer to self-host {productname}. What are my options?

* If you plan to use only open-source {productname} features, the open-source version is available under the _GNU General Public License Version 2 or later license_.
* If you want to self-host {productname} and use our Premium features, https://www.tiny.cloud/contact/[get in touch with our Sales team] for a custom quote.

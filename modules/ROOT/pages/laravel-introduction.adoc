https://laravel.com/[Laravel] is a scaleable web application framework built on PHP. The following guides provide procedures for creating a new Laravel project and adding {productname} to the project.

These guides assist with adding {productname} to pages or views in Laravel. The example Laravel projects created in these procedures are based on the Laravel project documented in the Laravel Docs, under https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/installation#installation-via-composer[Installation Via Composer]. These guides will create two blades: one for the JavaScript and another for the editor placeholder, to reflect how {productname} should be used in production environments.

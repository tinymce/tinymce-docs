[IMPORTANT]
====
{productname} 7 is licensed under the GNU General Public License Version 2 or later. A new configuration option called 'license_key' requires developers to make a conscious decision to use {productname} with the GPLv2+ license or with a commercial license.

If you are using {productname} in a self-hosted environment, a console log warning message will display if the license key config option is missing or invalid. This message aims to ensure compliance with licensing requirements and provide transparency during the evaluation period.

This message will not be shown when loading {productname} from {cloudname}, as it is already under a commercial license.

== FAQ

=== What does the GPL license mean?

{productname} 7 is licensed under the GNU General Public License Version 2 or later, often abbreviated to GPLv2+. https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html[Read more about the license terms here.^]

The GPLv2+ license was chosen to provide the best compatibility with existing GPL licensed open source projects.

=== What is the difference between a license key and the API key?

The **API key** is used when loading {productname} from the {cloudname}. The **license key** is used to declare the license terms when self-hosting {productname}.

=== Who needs to get a license key?

Anyone who intends to self-host {productname} will need to provide a valid commercial license key or declare their intention to use {productname} under the GPLv2+ license.

=== How will I know if this change affects me?

If {productname} detects that the `license_key` configuration is missing or invalid, it will display a console log warning. If you have actively suppressed or hidden this message, please remove those overrides. If no notification appears, you are not affected.

=== Should I be using both an API key and a license key?

No, an API key and a license key should not be used simultaneously. The API key should only be used if {productname} is loaded from the {cloudname}. If {productname} is being self-hosted, the license key option should be used instead.

=== Will {productname} “phone home” to check the license key?

No. {productname} does not contact any server to validate the license key.

=== What happens if I don't provide a valid license key?

The console log message or notification will persist until a valid license key or 'gpl' is provided. 

=== Why is a license key required?

The license key ensures compliance with {productname} licensing terms. It's part of our efforts to refine the license key system and may have additional functionalities in the future.

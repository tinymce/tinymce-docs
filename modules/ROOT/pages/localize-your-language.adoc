{productname} makes your project accessible to the world through its simple localization framework.

This section demonstrates how to change {productname}'s user interface to the user's language preference. These settings change the language in the toolbar, menu items, buttons, and tooltips.

NOTE: Language settings can be controlled in these configuration options: xref:content-localization.adoc#directionality[directionality], xref:content-localization.adoc#language[language] and  xref:content-localization.adoc#language_url[language_url]. There is also a xref:directionality.adoc[Directionality plugin] that adds a toolbar button to control `ltr-rtl` behavior.

== Step 1

Go to the link:{gettiny}/language-packages/[language download page] to review a list of language packs available for {productname}.

Click the download link on the far right of the table for a single language. Check the box beside each language and then click the download button at the bottom of the table for multiple languages.

IMPORTANT: The {productname} community translation project provides the language packs on our language download page.

== Step 2

Unpack the language `js` file(s) into the `path/to/tinymce/langs/` folder.

IMPORTANT: The language settings will not work unless the language pack is placed in `langs/` directory. The xref:content-localization.adoc#language_url[language_url] configuration option is another method to enable additional language settings.

== Step 3

Set the language option in {productname}'s configuration to the language code in the list on xref:content-localization.adoc#language[this page].

== Step 4

Load {productname} to confirm that the language is set correctly.

== A working example

The following code snippet sets {productname}'s language to Chinese and the text directionality from right to left.

link:{gettiny}/language-packages/[Download the Chinese language] pack to test this functionality. Install a _local instance_ of {productname} from the link:{gettiny}[downloads page]. Follow the xref:installation.adoc#self-hostedinstall[self-hosted install instructions].

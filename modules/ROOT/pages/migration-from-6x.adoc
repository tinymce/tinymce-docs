The process for setting up a basic {productname} 7 instance is the same as {productname} 6.

Most configuration changes in {productname} 7.0 only affect complex use cases, such as custom plugins and customized user interface components.


It set outs the {productname} 7.0 changes that customers using {productname} 6 should be aware of as part of upgrading.

[[tinymce-70-core-changes]]
== {productname} {productmajorversion} core changes.

For additional details on {productname} 7.0 changes, see xref:7.0-release-notes.adoc[{productname} 7.0 release notes].


[[commands-and-apis]]
== Commands and APIs 

This section documents the core changes made to {productname} 7.0.

=== Changed

==== Removed `InsertOrderedList` and `InsertUnorderedList` commands from {productname} core.

Previously, native list commands were executable through various text patterns, leading to undefined browser behavior due to the embedded list code.

In {productname} 7.0, these commands are only available in the xref:lists.adoc[*Lists plugin*].

.Example adding list plugin
[source, js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: "textarea",
  plugins: [
    "lists"
  ],
  toolbar: "bullist numlist",
});
----

[[remove-trailing-brs-configuration-property-was-removed-from-our-domparser-api]]
==== `remove_trailing_brs` configuration property was removed from our `DomParser` API

The `remove_trailing_brs` configuration property was moved to the serializer.

[TIP]
While the capability still exists for users that have added this option to their {productname} configuration, it is recommended that customers using our `DomParser` API directly, should migrate to use our `DomSerializer` setting instead.

[[changes-to-text-pattern-defaults-to-trigger-on-space-key-press]]
==== Changes to `text-pattern` defaults to trigger on `Space` key press.

Applying basic formats such as headings, lists, bold and italic while typing are considered core functionality for WYSIWYG Editor's. {productname}'s default behavior for applying these format styles was applied on `Enter`, not `Space`.

{productname} 7 introduces changes to the default behavior for `text-patterns` so that on **Space** key the editor triggers a xref:content-behavior-options.adoc#block-patterns[block patterns] rather than on `Enter` key press.

[NOTE]
Customers that wish to revert back to the previous default block `text_patterns` execution on `Enter` key pressing will be required to replace the preconfigured text_patterns. Learn more about how you can configure `text_patterns` in the xref:7.0-release-notes.adoc#a-new-trigger-property-for-block-text-pattern-configurations-allowing-pattern-activation-with-either-space-or-enter-keys[7.0 Release notes]

.Updated default text patterns
[source, ts]
----
default: [
  { start: '#', format: 'h1', trigger: 'space' },
  { start: '##', format: 'h2', trigger: 'space' },
  { start: '###', format: 'h3', trigger: 'space' },
  { start: '####', format: 'h4', trigger: 'space' },
  { start: '#####', format: 'h5', trigger: 'space' },
  { start: '######', format: 'h6', trigger: 'space' },
  { start: '1.', cmd: 'InsertOrderedList', trigger: 'space' },
  { start: '*', cmd: 'InsertUnorderedList', trigger: 'space' },
  { start: '-', cmd: 'InsertUnorderedList', trigger: 'space' },
  { start: '>', cmd: 'mceBlockQuote', trigger: 'space' },
  { start: '---', cmd: 'InsertHorizontalRule', trigger: 'space' },
]
----

For information on the **text_patterns**, see xref:content-behavior-options.adoc#text_patterns[Text Patterns].

=== Removed

==== The autocompleter `ch` configuration property has been removed. Use the `trigger` property instead.
// #TINY-8929

Previously, the `ch` configuration property was used to specify the character that would trigger the autocompleter.

This property was deprecated in link:https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/6.2-release-notes/#deprecated[{productname} 6.2] and has been removed in {productname} 7.0. Instead, use the `trigger` property to specify the `string` that will trigger the autocompleter.

If `+editor.ui.registry.addAutocompleter(name, options)+` was used in your configuration, updating your configuration from `ch: '<string>',` to `trigger: '<string>',` is required.

NOTE: The new `trigger` option can handle multiple character strings as the trigger.

For more information, visit the updated xref:autocompleter.adoc[Autocompleter] documentation.

[[options]]
== Options

=== Changed

[[highlight-on-focus]]
==== `highlight_on_focus`

Previously, the default value for the editor configuration option `highlight_on_focus` was set to `false` by default. In {productname} 7.0 this option is now by default set to `true`.

As a result, the focus outline for the editor will by default be displayed when the focus is on the editor.

Customers who have created their own custom skins, or have implemented their own outline and wish to not to use the default one will need to add the `highlight_on_focus: false` option to their {productname} configuration.

[NOTE]
This change does not impact editors using inline mode.

=== Removed

[[force-hex-color]]
==== `force_hex_color`

Previously in {productname} 6, all colors in the content HTML were set to use `rgb` values by default. As the common practice is using `hex` values this change has been reverted.

.Example
[source, html]
----
<!-- example using RGB values -->
<p>Hello <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">red</span> color</p>

<!-- example using HEX values -->
<p>Hello <span style="color: #ff0000">red</span> color</p>
----

In {productname} 7.0, all colors (excluding `rgba` values) are converted to use `hex` values and the `forced_hex_color` option has been removed.

[[plugins]]
== Plugins

=== Changed

==== Changed the `media_url_resolver` option to use promises.
// #TINY-9154

In {productname} 6, the `media_url_resolver` option used a callback rather than a promise, which lead to unforeseen consequences.

To rectify this, all instances of `media_url_resolver` were refactored to utilize promises in {productname} 7.

.Before refactor when using callbacks
[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  plugins: 'media',
  toolbar: 'media',
  media_url_resolver: (data, resolve/*, reject*/) => {
    if (data.url.indexOf('YOUR_SPECIAL_VIDEO_URL') !== -1) {
      const embedHtml = `<iframe src="${data.url}" width="400" height="400" ></iframe>`;
      resolve({ html: embedHtml });
    } else {
      resolve({ html: '' });
    }
  }
});
----

.After refactor using promises
[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  plugins: 'media',
  toolbar: 'media',
  media_url_resolver: (data) => {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      if (data.url.indexOf('YOUR_SPECIAL_VIDEO_URL') !== -1) {
        const embedHtml = `<iframe src="${data.url}" width="400" height="400" ></iframe>`;
        resolve({ html: embedHtml });
      } else {
        resolve({ html: '' });
      }
    });
  }
});
----

[NOTE]
Integrators will be required to update there configuration to the reflect the new `media_url_resolver` changes.

For more information on using `+media_url_resolver+`, see xref:media.adoc#media_url_resolver[media_url_resolver]


[[removed-plugins]]
=== Removed Plugins

In {productname} 7.0 the below plugin has been removed.

[[removed-plugins-template-plugin]]
==== Removed open-source `Template` plugin

The open-source `Template` plugin and associated config options have been removed in {productname} 7.0.

Customers using the `template` plugin need to migrate to the premium `advtemplate` which contains all the functionality except some esoteric options.

This plugin has been replaced with the **Advanced Template** plugin, see: xref:advanced-templates.adoc[Advanced Template] for more details.

[IMPORTANT]
For customers using the `template` plugin and are looking to migrate to the premium `advtemplate` plugin which contains all the functionality except some specific options which are noted below.

Options not available in **Advanced Template** plugin
    
* `template_cdate_classes`
* `template_cdate_format`
* `template_mdate_classes`
* `template_mdate_format`
* `template_replace_values`
* `template_preview_replace_values`
* `template_selected_content_classes`


[[ui-and-ux]]
== UI and UX

=== Changed

[[ui-and-ux-improved-how-styles-are-applied-when-resizing-rows-and-columns-for-tables]]
==== Changed how cell and row heights are applied to tables.

Previously, {productname} added numerous `height` styles when resizing table rows such as on the `table` element, `tr` elements, and `td` elements. This resulted in unnecessarily verbose HTML output.

{productname} 7.0 addresses this by making a couple of changes:

* The height input field has been removed from the "Cell Properties" dialog. Now, the "Row Properties" dialog is the only way to update row heights. 
* When a table is resized using the resize handles or the "Row properties" dialog, existing `height` styles will be stripped from `td/th` elements where applicable and only applied to the `table` element and `tr` elements.

[NOTE]
{productname} 7.0 does not provide any fallback to revert to the old behavior.

=== Removed

[[ui-and-ux-force-notifications-to-have-a-close-button]]
==== Force notifications to have a close button

Previously, {productname} had the option to modify default notifications so that they do not have display a `X` (close button).

{productname} is committed to enhance accessibility for all users, and aim to create consistency across all notifications and establish a standard tabbing flow for keyboard users.

As of {productname} 7.0, the `closeButton` property has been removed from xref:creating-custom-notifications.adoc[notification API], as a result the `closeButton` will always be visible.

[[security]]
== Security

=== Changed

[[sandbox-iframes-option]]
==== `sandbox_iframes`

In {productname} 6.8.1, the xref:content-filtering.adoc#sandbox-iframes[sandbox iframes] editor option was introduced to allow iframes to be sandboxed by default when inserted into the editor.

In {productname} 7.0, the default for `+sandbox_iframes+` will change from `false` to `true`, meaning that all `+iframe+` elements inserted into the editor will be given the `sandbox=""` attribute by default, preventing most actions, including scripting and same-origin access, which may break existing editor content or produce undesirable effects.

To prevent any expected iframes from being sandboxed, we recommend adding the source domains of such iframes to the new xref:content-filtering.adoc#sandbox-iframes-exclusions[`+sandbox_iframes_exclusions+`] option list, and including the domains in the default list where necessary. To prevent all iframes from being sandboxed, set the option `+sandbox_iframes+` to `+false+` in your editor configuration.

For further details on the `+sandbox_iframes+` option, see the xref:content-filtering.adoc#sandbox-iframes[the content filtering options], or refer to the xref:security.adoc#sandbox-iframes[security guide], or the link:https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/6.8.1-release-notes/#new-sandbox_iframes-option-that-controls-whether-iframe-elements-will-be-added-a-sandbox-attribute-to-mitigate-malicious-intent[{productname} 6.8.1 release notes].

For more information on the `sandbox_iframes` option see xref:security.adoc#sandbox-iframes[sandbox_iframes].

[[convert-unsafe-embeds-option]]
==== `convert_unsafe_embeds`

In {productname} 6.8.1, xref:content-filtering.adoc#convert-unsafe-embeds[convert_unsafe_embeds] editor option was introduced to allow `+object+` and `+embed+` elements to be converted by default to the correct element, respective of the MIME type, automatically when inserted into the editor.

In {productname} 7.0, the default value for `+convert_unsafe_embeds+` will change from `false` to `true`, meaning that all `+object+` and `+embed+` tags will automatically be converted to different elements when inserted to the editor.

{productname} has a configuration option that converts object tags to modern equivalents such as `<img>, <video>` and `<audio>` tags, such as;

.Example of before/after conversion.
[source, html]
----
<!-- Before Conversion -->
<object type="video/mp4" data="https://sneak-preview.tiny.cloud/3adc27b5-bb2f-49f0-9ccc-72b7c48313b0/bad.mov"></object>

<!-- After Conversion -->
<video src="https://sneak-preview.tiny.cloud/3adc27b5-bb2f-49f0-9ccc-72b7c48313b0/bad.mov" controls="controls"></video>
----
[NOTE]
If this behaviour is undesirable, set `+convert_unsafe_embeds+` to `+false+` in your editor configuration.

For further details on the `+convert_unsafe_embeds+` option, see the xref:content-filtering.adoc#convert-unsafe-embeds[content filtering options], or refer to the xref:security.adoc#convert-unsafe-embeds[security guide], or the link:https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/6.8.1-release-notes/#new-convert_unsafe_embeds-option-that-controls-whether-object-and-embed-elements-will-be-converted-to-more-restrictive-alternatives-namely-img-for-image-mime-types-video-for-video-mime-types-audio-audio-mime-types-or-iframe-for-other-or-unspecified-mime-types[{productname} 6.8.1 release notes].

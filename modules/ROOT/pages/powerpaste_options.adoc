=== Pre-filtering and post-filtering callbacks

Developers can add custom filtering before and after *PowerPaste*'s filters are run using the pre-filtering and post-filtering callbacks. These can be added as init options or at runtime using event listeners.

____
*Note*: These callbacks are also triggered by the core Paste plugin, but when triggered by PowerPaste they are passed more data.

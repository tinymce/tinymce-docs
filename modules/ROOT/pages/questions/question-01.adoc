1. For each plugin re-classified as premium, the following sentence (and link) was used to denote this:

   *{plugin-name} is now a https://tiny.cloud/tinymce/features/#productivity[Premium plugin].*

   Is this desirable, or does it read too much like marketing?
   
   Is there, perhaps, a better URL to link out with?

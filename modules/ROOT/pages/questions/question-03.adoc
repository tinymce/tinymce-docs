3. https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-8333[TINY-8333] (removing
   the `imagetools` dialogue component) has been documented as part of
   the _move `imagetools` to Premium_ documentation. Itâ€™s documented
   as such in

  * Release Notes > Plugins > new and improved;

  * Release Notes > Plugins > removed or deprecated; and

  * Migration Guide > Plugins > ImageTools.

  So, strictly speaking, this change is not separately and overtly
  documented. My read of this, however, is that this is the sensible
  and reasonable approach.
  
  Is my read reasonable?

5. In *TinyMCE 5.x*, the `paste_data_images` option was set to `false`
   by default. In *TinyMCE 6.0* it is set to `true`.

   When the default was set to `false`, this prevented images being
   pasted from the local machine.

   When upgrading to 6.0, `paste` goes from being a plugin to being
   Core functionality. Does this, as a consequence, cause the default
   to be changed?

   And, if so, should this change in the `paste_data_images` default
   be included in the *Migration Guide*?

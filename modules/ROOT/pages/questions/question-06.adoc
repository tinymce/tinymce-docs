6. `paste` no longer supports Microsoft Word.

   What precisely does this mean? If I copy styled text from Microsoft
   Word and paste it into a text editor running on my own machine (eg
   *BBEdit*), all the formatting is lost, but the text is pasted
   without issue.

   Does the new `paste` not even support this capability? Or does it
   function like a locally hosted text-editor and the ‘Word is not
   supported as a source for pasting’ language is designed to head-off
   the support tickets that will inevitably come if we even hint that
   there is some level of support for pasting from Word?

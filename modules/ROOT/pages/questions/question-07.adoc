7. two re-namings happened consequent to `noneditable` being re-cast
from being a plugin to being part of Core:

   * `noneditable_noneditable_class` became `noneditable_class`

   * `noneditable_editable_class`    became `editable_class`

   Socratic question: are these re-named options *Functions* or
   *Commands*?

   Do these re-namings constitute something an upgrader needs to be
   aware of? That is, does the re-naming need to be noted in the
   _Migration Guide_? And, if so, what does the upgrader need to do to
   cater to the change?

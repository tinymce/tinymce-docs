8. A re-naming happened consequent to `textpatterns` being re-cast
from being a plugin to being part of Core:

   * `textpattern_patterns` became `text_patterns`

   Socratic question: is this re-named item a *Function* or a
   *Command*?

   Does this re-naming constitute something an upgrader needs to be
   aware of? That is, does the re-naming need to be noted in the
   _Migration Guide_? (And, if so, what does the upgrader need to do
   to cater to the change?)

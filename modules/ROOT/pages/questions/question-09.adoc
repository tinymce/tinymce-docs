9. Itâ€™s noted in https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-8312[TINY-8312]
   that:

   > text patterns are on by default `text_patterns: false` or
   > `text_patterns: []` will turn the functionality off

   Is this a change from previously?

   Or, if not, has the means of turning the functionality off (if
   desired) changed from previously?

   And, if it has changed, does this change constitute something an
   upgrader needs to be aware of? That is, does this change need to be
   noted in the _Migration Guide_?

11. the following plugins were removed from _TinyMCE 6.0_.

    * `fullpage`
    * `spellchecker`
    * `bbcode`
    * `legacyoutput`
    * `colorpicker`
    * `contextmenu`

    Are they otherwise available in any fashion (eg as a
    maintained-by-a-third-party-but-entirely-unsupported-by-us
    option)?

12. The `media` plugin’s `media_scripts` option, which was deprecated
    in 5.10, has been removed as of 6.0.

    According to https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-8086[TINY-086]:

    > Matthew Thackwell was reviewing the media docs and we couldn’t
    > figure out what the `media_scripts` setting does and based on
    > the description it doesn’t seem to make sense to keep around
    > anymore

    a. Does anyone know what the setting did?

    b. Is it safe to just document the option’s removal, leaving
    discovery of whatever (currently unknown) functionality is lost to
    the end-user(s) who was, previously, making use of said unknown
    capability?

13. According to https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/DOC-1533[DOC-1533]:

    > The media plugin and TinyMCE 5x parser had a unique way of
    > preserving embedded content except for script, no script, svgs.

    I assume, from https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-8382[TINY-8382],
    the old parser was
    
    https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/xml/parsers/SAXParser.html[SaxParser].

    Does the new parser have a name and source?

    And, assuming the new parser has both these things, should they be
    mentioned as part of the _Release Notes_?

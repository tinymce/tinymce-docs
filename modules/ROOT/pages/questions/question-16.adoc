16. Options in the `link` plugin were re-named. To wit:

   * `default_link_target` became `link_default_target`.

   * `rel_list` became `link_rel_list`.

   * `target_list` became `link_target_list`.

   Socratic question: are these re-named options *Functions* or
   *Commands*?

   Also, why were these options re-named?

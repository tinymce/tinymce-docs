18. https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-4603[TINY-4603] notes
    the re-naming of `default_link_target` to `link_default_target`
    _also applies to `autolink`_.

    Should this be documented entirely separately or is it safe to
    just note the re-naming also applies to `autolink`?

    For, example, if users interact with the `autolink` plugin
    separately to the `link` plugin (by, for example, setting
    user-adjustable options separately for each plugin), the change to
    `autolink` should be explicitly documented, in case there are
    users whoâ€™ve tweaked one plugin and not the other.

19. A state of gentle confusion as much as a question.

    According to https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-7820[TINY-7820]

    > tab_focus [part of the `tabfocus` plugin] is superseded by
    > `tabfocus_elements`

    According to
    https://notion.so/tinycloud/6-0-Docs-Notes-94ee2ecf10ff440b9246a22f8cc54828#23efdaf60a994e35bb014d0353f4e3ea[TabFocus block in Notion article on 6.0 Changes], however:

    > the `tabfocus_elements` option no longer does anything

    Is the below the sequence of events?

    a. `tabfocus` option re-named: if you used `tab_focus`, use
       `tabfocus_elements` now.

    b. `tabfocus` plugin now gone: its functionality is now part of
       Core {productname}. If you used `tabfocus_elements`, use the
       `tabindex` attribute now.

    c. Oops, also, we’ve now actually removing the whole `tabfocus`
       plugin, which removes the renamed/deprecated `tab_focus` option
       _and_ its re-named replacement: `tabfocus_elements`.

    d. Everyone use the `tabindex` attribute now. It’s part of
       {productname} Core.

    FYI: I’ve added documentation to my _Release Notes_
    work-in-progress on the assumption my intuited sequence of events
    above is basically accurate.

20. I’ve documented the https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-8104[TINY-8104]
    bug-fix as follows:

    * If the selected cells in the `tfoot` section of a table were
      header elements (ie were `th` elements), pressing the `table`
      row header toolbar button (which invokes the `mceTableRowType`
      command) returned the row as a header row.

      This was incorrect: the section takes precedence and cells in
      the `tfoot` section of a table should be declared as a footer
      row.

      In {productname} 6.0, selecting cells in the `tfoot` section of
      a table and pressing the row header toolbar button returns the
      row as a footer row, as expected.


    Two questions:

    a. is this correct?

    b. I’ve assumed, because this concerns the _row header toolbar
       button_, this is a fix for the now-only-concerned-with-UI
       `table` plugin, and not the now-in-the-Core table creation
       ‘engine’ code. Is this also a correct assumption?

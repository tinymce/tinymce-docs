21. `mceInsertTable`` -> `mceInsertTableDialog`

    `mceInsertTableDialog` is documented as a new command

    But, from a user-POV, is it sensible to document this as a
    re-naming?

    _We changed the name of the `mceInsertTable` command to
    `mceInsertTableDialog`._

    _To invoke an insert table dialogue box, use the new command
    name._

    Or, are there other changes that a user should be aware of?

    Also, is the name change just to ensure there isn’t a name-space
    conflict or is the new command name also an effort to make the
    command better reflect what it does. That is the command never
    inserted a table, it always invoked a table-creation dialogue box,
    and now the command name accurately reflects this?

    Also also, I’m assuming this is a change that needs to be noted in
    the _Migration Guide_. A useful assumption?

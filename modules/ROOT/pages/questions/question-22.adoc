22. Two elements default values were changed: 

    | element               | old value | new value |
    | --------------------- | --------- | --------- |
    | `table_style_by_css`  | `false`   | `true`    |
    | `table_use_colgroups` | `false`   | `true`    |

    Why?

    With regards the first value, my instant thought is _because doing
    things with spot formatting is nuts._

    And the ticket — https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-8259[TINY-8259] —
    suggests I’m on the right track:

    > In the future we would like to update the table plugin to purely
    > use modern styles, and this setting could be deleted, but we
    > don’t have time for that now.

    I’m inclined to think ‘modern styles’ is shorthand for more
    ambitious goals. For example: _unless the table’s style is managed
    by the style sheet, we can’t apply site-wide themes to tables
    safely._

    Is there any any virtue in alluding to whatever plans _we don’t
    have time for… now_ in the docs, or should the explanation be more
    generic:

    *Defaulting to using CSS is in line with modern web practices.*

    With regards the second value, the only note in
    https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-8259[TINY-8259] is
    _Modernisation_.

    So, a default explanation for the change would be along the same
    lines as the anodyne note above re CSS:

    *Defaulting to using `colgroups` is in line with modern web practices.*

23. Another state of gentle confusion as much as a question.

    According to https://ephocks.atlassian.net/browse/TINY-7820[TINY-7820]

    > `table_responsive_width` [part of the `table` plugin] is
    > superseded by `table_sizing_mode`

    And, according to https://notion.so/tinycloud/6-0-Docs-Notes-94ee2ecf10ff440b9246a22f8cc54828#5cb07d715fee4f3db9a10481e709fa8b[Table block in Notion article on 6.0 Changes] we

    > Removed the deprecated `table_responsive_width` option

    Is the below the sequence of events?

    a. `table_responsive_width` option superseded: if you used
       `table_responsive_width`, use `table_sizing_mode` now.

    b. We’ve now removed the `table_responsive_width` option entirely.
       You *really* have to use `table_sizing_mode` now.
       `table_responsive_width` isn’t even there anymore.

    FYI: I’ve added documentation to my _Release Notes_
    work-in-progress on the assumption my intuited sequence of events
    above is basically accurate.

title: external_link_list_url

This option enables you to have an external list of links, which can be generated by a server side page and then inserted into the link dialog windows of TinyMCE. The links can be to internal site documents or external URLs.

Change in 3.0: The way that relative URLs are calculated has changed since the 2.x version - you may want to use absolute URLs for this setting.

## Example of usage of the external_link_list_url option:

```js
tinyMCE.init({
  ...
  external_link_list_url : "myexternallist.js"
});
```

Note: If utilizing the [document_base_url](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs-3x/reference/configuration/Configuration3x@document_base_url/) option, the path to your file is relative from that base. If not set, your path is relative from the file containing the editor call.

## Example of a external link list file: (myexternallist.js)

```js
var tinyMCELinkList = new Array(
  // Name, URL
  ["Moxiecode", "http://www.moxiecode.com"],
  ["Freshmeat", "http://www.freshmeat.com"],
  ["Sourceforge", "http://www.sourceforge.com"]
);
```

## Example of a PHP-generated external link list file

See the [example of a PHP-generated image list file](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs-3x/reference/configuration/Configuration3x@external_image_list_url/) for comparison.

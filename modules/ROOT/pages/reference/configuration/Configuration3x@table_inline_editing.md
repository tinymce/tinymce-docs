layout: default
title: table_inline_editing

This true/false option gives you the ability to turn on/off the inline table editing controls in Firefox/Mozilla. These controls are somewhat buggy and not redesignable so they are disabled by default.

## Example of usage of the table_inline_editing option:

```js
tinyMCE.init({
  ...
  table_inline_editing : true
});
```

[[generalbugfixes]]
== General bug fixes

{productname} 5.10 provides fixes for the following bugs:

* Fixed a regression that caused block wrapper formats to apply and remove incorrectly when using a collapsed selection with multiple words.
* Resizing table columns in some scenarios would resize the column to an incorrect position.
* Inserting a table where the parent element had padding would cause the table width to be incorrect.
* The resize backdrop element did not have the `data-mce-bogus="all"` attribute set to prevent it being included in output.
* Resize handles appeared on top of dialogs and menus when using an inline editor.
* Fixed the `autoresize` plugin incorrectly scrolling to the top of the editor content in some cases when changing content.
* Fixed the `editor.selection.scrollIntoView()` type signature, as it incorrectly required an `Element` instead of `HTMLElement`.
* Table cells that were both row and column headers did not retain the correct state when converting back to a regular row or column.
* Clicking beside a non-editable element could cause the editor to incorrectly scroll to the top of the content.
* Clicking in a table cell, with a non-editable element in an adjacent cell, incorrectly caused the non-editable element to be selected.
* Split toolbar buttons incorrectly had nested `tabindex="-1"` attributes.
* Fixed notifications rendering in the wrong place initially and when the page was scrolled.
* Fixed an exception getting thrown when the number of `col` elements didn't match the number of columns in a table.
* The table selection state could become incorrect after selecting a noneditable table cell.
* As of Mozilla Firefox 91, toggling fullscreen mode with `toolbar_sticky` enabled would cause the toolbar to disappear.
* Fixed the `image` and `media` toolbar buttons incorrectly appearing to be in an inactive state in some cases.
* Fixed the `editor.selection.selectorChanged` API not firing if the selector matched the current selection when registered in some cases.
* Inserting content into a `contenteditable="true"` element that was contained within a `contenteditable="false"` element would move the selection to an incorrect location.
* Dragging and dropping `contenteditable="false"` elements could result in the element being placed in an unexpected location.
* Pressing the Escape key would not cancel a drag action that started on a `contenteditable="false"` element within the editor.
* `video` and `audio` elements were unable to be played when the `media` plugin live embeds were enabled in some cases.
* Pasting images would throw an exception if the clipboard `items` were not files (for example, screenshots taken from gnome-software). Patch contributed by cedric-anne.

[[securityfixes]]
== Security fixes

{productname} 5.10 provides fixes for the following security issues.

Fixed URLs not cleaned correctly in some cases in the `link` and `image` plugins. This caused a medium severity Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Tiny Technologies would like to thank Yakir6 for discovering this vulnerability.

[[deprecatedfeatures]]
== Deprecated features

For a full list of the features deprecated since the release of {productname} 5.0, see: xref:release-notes/6.0-upcoming-changes.adoc[List of upcoming changes for {productname} 6].

The following features have been deprecated with the release of {productname} 5.10:

* xref:plugins[Plugins]
* xref:options[Options]
* xref:apis[APIs]

[[plugins]]
=== Plugins

Image Tools (`imagetools`):: {productname} {productminorversion} includes the final release of the Image Tools plugin (`imagetools`) as an open source plugin. The Image Tools plugin will be removed from the open source bundle and be available as a premium plugin from {productname} 6.0.

Table of Contents (`toc`):: {productname} {productminorversion} includes the final release of the Table of Contents (`toc`) as an open source plugin. The Table of Contents plugin will be removed from the open source bundle and be available as a premium plugin from {productname} 6.0.

[[options]]
=== Options

The following settings are not being deprecated, but a supported value or behavior will be removed in {productname} 6.0.

toolbar_mode:: The xref:configure/editor-appearance.adoc#toolbar_mode[`toolbar_mode`] option will no-longer accept the `false` value in {productname} 6.0, which was retained for backwards compatibility with the `toolbar_drawer` option. Use `'wrap'` instead to keep the same functionality as `false`.

forced_root_block:: The xref:configure/content-filtering.adoc#forced_root_block[`forced_root_block`] option will no-longer accept the `false` value or an empty string value in {productname} 6.0. Setting `forced_root_block` to `false` is not compatible with Real-time Collaboration. It also blocks various editor functions from working correctly and causes non-semantic HTML to be generated.

The following options have been deprecated in {productname} 5.10.

autoresize_on_init:: The xref:plugins/opensource/autoresize.adoc#autoresize_on_init[`autoresize_on_init`] option does not affect the autoresize behavior in {productname} 5, as the editor will always resize regardless of this option. This option would only forcibly resize at short intervals after the editor has initialized, which is no longer required and as such will be removed.

convert_fonts_to_spans:: The xref:configure/content-filtering.adoc#convert_fonts_to_spans[`convert_fonts_to_spans`] option would convert `font` elements to `span` styles to assist with the migration to newer HTML standards. Font elements were included in HTML 3 or earlier standards and have since been deprecated or removed.

media_scripts:: The xref:plugins/opensource/media.adoc#media_scripts[`media_scripts`] option is no longer useful in the modern web and did not work in most cases. As such it has been deprecated in {productname} 5.10.

paste_convert_word_fake_lists:: The Microsoft Word specific paste handling functionality will be removed from the `paste` plugin. As a result, the xref:plugins/opensource/paste.adoc#paste_convert_word_fake_lists[`paste_convert_word_fake_lists`] option will be removed in {productname} 6.0.

paste_retain_style_properties:: The Microsoft Word specific paste handling functionality will be removed from the `paste` plugin. As a result, the xref:plugins/opensource/paste.adoc#paste_retain_style_properties[`paste_retain_style_properties`] option will be removed in {productname} 6.0.

paste_word_valid_elements:: The Microsoft Word specific paste handling functionality will be removed from the `paste` plugin. As a result, the xref:plugins/opensource/paste.adoc#paste_word_valid_elements[`paste_word_valid_elements`] option will be removed in {productname} 6.0.

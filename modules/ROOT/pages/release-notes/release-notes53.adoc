[[tinymce53newfeaturesandenhancements]]
== TinyMCE 5.3 new features and enhancements

The following new features and enhancements were added for the {productname} 5.3 release.

=== New toolbar location default setting

{productname} 5.3 includes a new default, `auto`, for the `toolbar_location` option. The `auto` option positions the toolbar and menu bar either:

* Above the content area by default.
* Below the content area if there is not enough space to display the toolbar and menu bar above.

This new default setting has been added to improve the user experience for the editor in inline mode.

For information on:

* The `toolbar_location` option, see: xref:configure/editor-appearance.adoc#toolbar_location[User interface options - toolbar_location].
* {productname} in inline mode, see: xref:general-configuration-guide/use-tinymce-inline.adoc#enablinginlineeditingmode[Setup inline editing mode].

=== Moved the 'enabled' checkmark on toggle menu items to the right-hand side

The checkmark on toggle menu items that indicates that an option is enabled, has been moved. The checkmark will now appear to the right of the menu label. This change provides clearer feedback to users and allows icons to be added to toggle menu items.
For example:

[cols="^,^"]
|===
| {productname} 5.2 toggle menu item checkmark behavior | {productname} 5.3 toggle menu item checkmark behavior

| image:old_togglemenuitemchecked.png[Custom toggle menu item with checkmark on the left-hand side of the item label (pre-5.3 behavior)]
| image:53_togglemenuitemchecked.png[Custom toggle menu item with checkmark on the right-hand side of the item label (5.3+ behavior)]
|===

For information on toggle menu items, see: xref:ui-components/menuitems.adoc#togglemenuitems[Custom menu items - Toggle menu items].

=== New find and replace in selection functionality

A new "Find in selection" option has been added to the Find and Replace dialog provided by the Search and Replace plugin.

For example:

image::find-replace-in-selection.png[Find and Replace dialog with new "Find in selection" option highlighted]

For information on enabling the Find and Replace dialog, see: xref:plugins/opensource/searchreplace.adoc[the Search and Replace plugin].

=== Multiple context toolbars can now be concatenated

In situations where more than one context toolbar could be shown, they will be concatenated instead of prioritizing one of the context toolbars. This includes context toolbars provided by the Quick Toolbars plugin.

For information on:

* The Quick Toolbars plugin, see: xref:plugins/opensource/quickbars.adoc[The Quick Toolbars plugin].
* Creating custom context toolbars, see: xref:ui-components/contexttoolbar.adoc[Context toolbars].

[[removalofjava7support]]
=== Removal of Java 7 support

Java 7 support has been removed with this release. The {productname} Java server-side components now require a minimum of Java 8. From the {productname} 5.3 release, the `.war` files provided in the self-hosted bundles will not be compatible with Java 7. This change resolves security issues present in the older versions of these services. The following plugins are affected by this change:

* SpellChecker Pro (`tinymcespellchecker`) - `ephox-spelling.war` has been updated to version `2.3.0`.
* Image Tools (`imagetools`) - `ephox-image-proxy.war` has been updated to version `2.3.0`.
* Enhanced Media Embed (`mediaembed`) - `ephox-hyperlinking.war` has been updated to version `2.3.0`.
* Link Checker (`linkchecker`) - `ephox-hyperlinking.war` has been updated to version `2.3.0`.

=== Pre-configured Dockerfiles for containerizing the server-side components

From {productname} 5.3, premium self-hosted bundles include the files required to build and deploy the server-side components as Docker containers. For information on Docker deployments of the server-side components, see: xref:enterprise/server/dockerservices.adoc[Containerized service deployments].

For information on deploying the server-side components using Docker, see: xref:enterprise/server/dockerservices.adoc[Containerized service deployments].

=== Regular Expression support for allowed-origins

Version 2.3.0 of the {productname} server-side components adds support for using regular expressions to specify `allowed-origins`. For information on using regular expressions for specifying allowed origins, see: xref:enterprise/server/configure.adoc#regularexpressionssupport[Configure server-side components - Regular Expressions support].

=== New configuration option for simplifying same-origin deployments

The new `same-origin` option allows all cross-origin requests to be blocked by the server while allowing all same-origin requests.

For information on configuring the same-origin option, see: xref:enterprise/server/configure.adoc#allowed-originssame-originoptional[Configure server-side components - allowed-origins.same-origin (optional)].

=== New alternative http timeout settings

Three new http timeout settings have been added to the server-side components. These new settings provide greater control over the timeout length of requests that the existing `request-timeout-seconds` configuration setting.

For information on configuring the alternative http timeout settings, see: xref:enterprise/server/configure.adoc#alternativehttptimeoutsettings[Configure server-side components - Alternative http timeout settings].

=== New `fallback-to-get` setting for the Link Checker service

The new `fallback-to-get` configuration setting allows the Link checker can correctly identify working URLs that return non-standard `HEAD` replies.

For information on configuring the Link Checker service, see: xref:enterprise/server/configure.adoc#link-checkingoptional[Configure server-side components - `link-checking`]

[[deprecatedfeatures]]
== Deprecated features

The `images_dataimg_filter` option has been deprecated with the release of {productname} 5.3 and may be removed in a future release of {productname}. This option can be used for an unintended use-case that will likely be incompatible with the future introduction of real-time collaboration support.

* The `images_dataimg_filter` option, see: xref:configure/file-image-upload.adoc#images_dataimg_filter[Image & file options - images_dataimg_filter].

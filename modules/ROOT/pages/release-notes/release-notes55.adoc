== TinyMCE 5.5 new features and enhancements

The following new features and enhancements were added for the {productname} 5.5 release.

=== TinyMCE core Typescript types are now public

The {productname} core now has a fully-typed programming interface. This will help developers by allowing the {productname} APIs to be integrated into developer tools. This change can help developers avoid incorrect usage of the {productname} APIs, reducing the likelihood of bugs in custom UI components and plugins. This will also allow some IDEs to provide autocompletion for plugin and component development.

For example:

[cols="^,^"]

|===

For information on:

* Creating custom {productname} user interface components; such as toolbar buttons, menu items, and dialogs; see: link:{baseurl}/ui-components/[User interface components].
* Creating a plugin for {productname}, see: link:{baseurl}/advanced/creating-a-plugin/[Create a plugin for {productname}].
* The {productname} APIs, see: link:{baseurl}/api/[The {productname} API Reference].

=== New line height support in the editor

{productname} 5.5 now supports adjustable line heights. There is a new `lineheight` button available for toolbars, and a new `lineheight` menu item (included by default in the format menu). There is also a new `LineHeight` editor command to change line height and a `LineHeight` query command value to get the current line height.

For information on:

* The `lineheight` toolbar button, see: link:{baseurl}/advanced/available-toolbar-buttons/#thecoretoolbarbuttons[Available Toolbar Buttons - The core toolbar buttons].
* The `lineheight` menu item, see: link:{baseurl}/advanced/available-menu-items/#the-core-menu-items[Available Menu Items - The core menu items].
* The `LineHeight` editor command, see: link:{baseurl}/advanced/editor-command-identifiers/#coreeditorcommands[Commands available for {productname} - Core Editor commands].
* The `LineHeight` query command value, see: link:{baseurl}/advanced/editor-command-identifiers/#availablequerycommandvalues[Commands available for {productname} - Available query command values].

=== New persistent toolbar option for inline mode

A new `toolbar_persist` option has been added for disabling the automatic show and hide behavior of the toolbar and menu bar for inline editors.

For information on the new persistent toolbar option, see: link:{baseurl}/configure/editor-appearance/#toolbar_persist[User interface options - `toolbar_persist`].

=== The toolbar drawer can now be controlled using commands

A new editor command (`execCommand('ToggleToolbarDrawer')`) and editor state query (`queryCommandState('ToggleToolbarDrawer')`) have been added. The command allows the Toolbar Drawer (which holds excess toolbar buttons) to be opened and closed using editor commands. The current state of the Toolbar Drawer can also be queried.

For information on:

* The Toolbar Drawer, see: link:{baseurl}/configure/editor-appearance/#toolbar_mode[User interface options - `toolbar_mode`].
* Commands and query commands available in {productname}, see: link:{baseurl}/advanced/editor-command-identifiers/[Commands Available for TinyMCE].

=== Nested menu items for class list, link list, and image list options

{productname} 5.5 reintroduces the ability to add nested menu items to the following options:

* `image_list`
* `image_class_list`
* `link_class_list`
* `link_list`
* `table_class_list`
* `table_cell_class_list`
* `table_row_class_list`

For example:

[source, js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  plugins: 'link',
  menubar: 'insert',
  toolbar: 'link',
  link_list: [
    {title: '{companyname} Home Page', value: '{url}'},
    {title: '{companyname} Blog', value: '{url}/blog'},
    {title: '{productname} Support resources',
      menu: [
        {title: '{productname} Documentation', value: '{url}/docs/'},
        {title: '{productname} on Stack Overflow', value: '{communitysupporturl}'},
        {title: '{productname} GitHub', value: 'https://github.com/tinymce/'}
      ]
    }

=== Added the ability to use the browser full screen mode with the `fullscreen` plugin

A new `fullscreen_native` option allows the editor to use the browser's full screen mode instead of only filling the browser viewport. When enabled and the user activates full screen mode, the editor will fill the whole screen, the same as full screen mode for online videos.

For information on the `fullscreen_native` option, see: link:{baseurl}/plugins/opensource/fullscreen/#fullscreen_native[Full Screen Plugin - `fullscreen_native`].

=== New `contextmenu_avoid_overlap` option for controlling the placement of context menus

The new `contextmenu_avoid_overlap` option can be used to prevent context menus from covering the selected node if the node matches the specified https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors[CSS selector].

For information on the `contextmenu_avoid_overlap` option, see: link:{baseurl}/configure/editor-appearance/#contextmenu_avoid_overlap[User interface options - `contextmenu_avoid_overlap`].

=== Added `colgroup` support for tables

A new `table_use_colgroups` option allows `colgroup` and `col` elements to be added to new tables. The `colgroup` and `col` elements can be used to set column widths. Other attributes are not supported in the TinyMCE 5.5 release.

For information on the `table_use_colgroups` option, see: link:{baseurl}/plugins/opensource/table/#table_use_colgroups[Table plugin - `table_use_colgroups`].

=== Added cut, copy, and paste table column menu items

Four new menu items have been added to the Table plugin to assist with moving and duplicating table columns:

* `tablecutcolumn`

* `tablepastecolumnbefore`
* `tablepastecolumnafter`

For information on the Table plugin menu items, see: link:{baseurl}/plugins/opensource/table/#menuitems[Table plugin - Menu items].

=== New `table_column_resizing` option for controlling table column resizing

A new `table_column_resizing` option sets whether a table or other columns are resized when a user resizes a table column.

For information on the `table_column_resizing` option, see: link:{baseurl}/plugins/opensource/table/#table_column_resizing[Table plugin - `table_column_resizing`].

=== Changes to the default table CSS

The CSS files bundled with {productname} have been updated to better support the styling options available in the `table` dialog.

* For information on the bundled CSS files, see: link:{baseurl}/general-configuration-guide/customize-ui/#customizingtheeditableareawithcontent_css[Customizing the editable area with `content_css`].
* To view the CSS files, see: https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce-dist/tree/master/skins/content[tinymce-dist GitHub Repository - Content CSS files].

=== New listbox component for custom dialogs

The new listbox component for custom dialogs is a composite component with a label and a dropdown list of options for users to select from. This component displays a menu-like dropdown and allows nested options to be shown to users.

For information on the listbox dialog component, see: link:{baseurl}/ui-components/dialogcomponents/#listbox[Dialog components - listbox].

=== New `hasPlugin` for detecting the availability of plugins

The new `hasPlugin` API method can be used to detect if a plugin is present in the editor configuration or if the plugin has been loaded. This API is useful if custom functionality such as a custom plugin, is dependent on the APIs of a plugin.

For information on the `editor.hasPlugin()` API, see: xref:apis/tinymce.editor.adoc#hasPlugin[tinymce.Editor APIs - `hasPlugin`].

=== New StyleSheetLoader `unload` and `unloadAll` APIs

Two new APIs have been added for unloading CSS files:

* `unload` - Unloads the specified CSS file if it is not in use.
* `unloadAll` - Accepts a list of URLs and unloads any CSS files not in use.

For information on the `unload` and `unloadAll` APIs, see: xref:apis/tinymce.dom.stylesheetloader.adoc[tinymce.dom.StyleSheetLoader].

=== Leading and trailing whitespace now retained by the `insert` and `setContent` APIs

The following APIs for setting or adding to the editor content have been updated to keep leading and trailing whitespace:

* `editor.insertContent()`
* `editor.selection.setContent()`

For information on:

* The `editor.insertContent()` API, see: xref:apis/tinymce.editor.adoc#insertContent[tinymce.Editor APIs - `insertContent`].
* The `editor.selection.setContent()` API, see: xref:apis/tinymce.dom.selection.adoc#setContent[tinymce.dom.Selection APIs - `setContent`].

=== Changed the Image Tools context toolbar icon

The icon for the Image Tools _image options_ toolbar button has changed from an ellipse icon (image:{baseurl}/images/icons/image-options.svg[Icon consisting of three dots horizontally aligned across the center of the icon]) to match the image icon (image:{baseurl}/images/icons/image.svg[Icon consisting of two hills, a sun above and a border representing a picture frame]).

For information on:

* The Image Tools plugin, see: link:{baseurl}/plugins/opensource/imagetools/[Image Tools plugin].
* The Image Tools context toolbar, see: link:{baseurl}/plugins/opensource/imagetools/#imagetools_toolbar[Image Tools plugin - `imagetools_toolbar`].

* Image Tools toolbar buttons, see: link:{baseurl}/plugins/opensource/imagetools/#toolbarbuttons[Image Tools plugin - Toolbar buttons].
* {productname} icons, see: link:{baseurl}/advanced/editor-icon-identifiers/[Icons Available for TinyMCE].

=== Improved navigation and deletion for media elements without the `media` plugin

`video` and `audio` HTML elements in the editor content no-longer cause navigation issues and can be deleted without the `media` plugin.

For information on the `media` plugin, see: link:{baseurl}/plugins/opensource/media/[Media plugin].

== Deprecated features

The following features have been deprecated with the release of {productname} 5.5:

* <<thepremiumspanishmexicolanguagepackhasbeendeprecated,The premium Spanish (Mexico) language pack has been deprecated>>.

=== The premium Spanish (Mexico) language pack has been deprecated

With the release of {productname} 5.5, the premium Spanish (Mexico) language pack (`es_MX`) has been deprecated and will not be updated in the future. The community-translated Spanish (Mexico) language pack is unaffected.

For information on the community maintained language packs, see: link:{baseurl}/configure/localization/#language[Localization options - `language`].

== Known issues

This section describes issues that users of {productname} 5.5 may encounter, as well as possible workarounds for these issues.

*Outline*

* <<difficulttoseetablecellselectionsfortablecellswithabackgroundcolor,Difficult to see table cell selections for table cells with a background color>>

=== Difficult to see table cell selections for table cells with a background color

*Issue*: Due to CSS changes related to table cell selections, it can be difficult to see the which cells are selected if the cells have a background color. This issue is both a usability and an accessibility issue.

*Workaround*: To improve the visibility of cell selections until this issue is fixed, use the `content_style` option to change the table-related cell selection style. For example:

[source, js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',
  plugins: 'table',
  content_style: '.mce-content-body td[data-mce-selected]::after, .mce-content-body th[data-mce-selected]::after { background-color: rgb(180, 215, 255, .7); }'
});
----

{companyname} recommends removing this workaround from the configuration when the issue has been fixed.

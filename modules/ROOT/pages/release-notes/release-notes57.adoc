[[newfeatures]]
== New features

The following new features were added for the {productname} 5.7 release.

=== Added support for `table_column_resizing` when inserting and deleting table columns

When inserting or deleting table columns, the resizing behavior will now respect the `table_column_resizing` option:

* `table_column_resizing: 'preservetable'` - The columns will resize to fit the width of the table.
* `table_column_resizing: 'resizetable'` - The table will resize to fit the width of the columns.

For information on the `table_column_resizing` option, see: xref:plugins/opensource/table.adoc#table_column_resizing[Table plugin - `table_column_resizing`].

=== Added new `font_css` option

The `font_css` option loads the specified font CSS files into both the editable area and the webpage {productname} is rendered in. This is useful for ensuring that {productname} UI uses the correct fonts for font family examples and for content that uses those fonts, or for ensuring {productname} content and content outside the editor that should use the same fonts renders correctly.

For information on the `font_css` option, see: xref:configure/content-appearance.adoc#font-css[Content Appearance - `font_css`].

[[enhancements]]
== Enhancements

The following enhancements were made for the {productname} 5.7 release.

=== Changes to notifications and popups when the editor is blocked

Notifications opened with the Notifications API will now remain visible when the editor's progress state is set to `true` using the {productname} `setProgressState()` API. Additionally, popups within the editor (such as context menus and inline dialogs) will now be closed while the editor's progress state is set to `true`.

For information on:

* The {productname} `setProgress()` API, see xref:apis/tinymce.editor.adoc#setProgressState[Editor API - `setProgressState`].
* The Notifications API, see xref:advanced/creating-custom-notifications.adoc[Create custom notifications].

=== Table widths are now retained when copying and pasting tables

Tables copied to the clipboard when using the `table` plugin will now correctly retain the width of each column. Additionally, the table width will be correctly adjusted to account for the copied column widths.

=== Improved behavior when using `lists` plugin on mixed content

The `lists` plugin has been updated to improve toggling lists on content containing:

* Multiple blocks of text.
* Combinations of existing lists and blocks of text.

=== Media live embeds now support video and audio elements

The `media_live_embeds` option now supports rendering live embeds of `audio` and `video` elements while editing content. The elements can now also be resized without having to open a dialog to manually change the size.

For information on the `media_live_embeds` option, see: xref:plugins/opensource/media.adoc#media_live_embeds[Media plugin - `media_live_embeds`].

=== Enhanced `TableModified` event data

The `TableModified` event now contains additional data which specifies whether the table structure, style, or both were modified.

For information on the `TableModified` event, see: xref:plugins/opensource/table.adoc#events[Table plugin - Events].

=== Added IPv6 URI parsing support

The {productname} `URI` API now supports parsing IPv6 URLs. This enhancement was a community contribution by dev7355608.

For information on the `URI` API, see: xref:apis/tinymce.util.uri.adoc[URI].

=== Additional enhancements

{productname} 5.7 introduces the following minor enhancements:

* Added a new `ImageUploader` API to simplify uploading image data to the configured `images_upload_url` or `images_upload_handler`.
* Added an Oxide variable to define the container background color in fullscreen mode.
* Added Oxide variables for setting the toolbar background colors for inline and sticky toolbars.
* Added a new `AfterProgressState` event that is fired after `editor.setProgressState` calls complete.
* Changed the `advlist` plugin to log a console error message when the `list` plugin isn't enabled.
* Changed the z-index of the `setProgressState(true)` throbber so it does not hide notifications.

* Changed some `SaxParser` regular expressions to improve performance.

[[knownissues]]
== Known issues

This section describes issues that users of {productname} 5.7 may encounter and possible workarounds for these issues.

*Outline*

* xref:rowsortingnotworkingfortableswithcolgroupelements[Row sorting not working for tables with `colgroup` elements]

[[rowsortingnotworkingfortableswithcolgroupelements]]
=== Row sorting not working for tables with `colgroup` elements

*Issue*: This issue affects the row sorting functionality provided by the *Advanced Tables* plugin. If a row sort is performed on a table containing colgroups, the editor will return invalid HTML.

*Workaround*: For existing or pasted tables containing `colgroup` elements, there was no known workaround at the time of the release. To prevent colgroups being added to new tables created using {productname}, set the `table_use_colgroups` option to `false` (`false` by default).

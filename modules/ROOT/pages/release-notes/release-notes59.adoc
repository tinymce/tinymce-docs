[[enhancements]]
== Enhancements

The following enhancements were made for the {productname} 5.9 release.

=== Improved context toolbar user experience

{productname} 5.9 improves context toolbar positioning by ensuring the toolbar remains in the same position when the user scrolls. Additionally, the context toolbar repositions if the toolbar will overlap the selected content or the cursor. For example: Prior to this improvement, if a user was editing a table, the context toolbar may have covered cells in the first row while it was being edited. Now, when clicking into any cell within that row, the toolbar will move to the bottom of the viewport instead.

To further enhance the user experience, the context toolbar will now use a short animation when the toolbar transitions between different locations.

image:context-toolbar-improvements.gif[Enchanced context toolbar behavior]

For information on context toolbars, see: xref:ui-components/contexttoolbar.adoc[UI components - Context toolbar].

=== New `toolbar_sticky_offset` option for customizing sticky toolbars

The new `toolbar_sticky_offset` option allows the main toolbar to "dock" at a specified offset from the top or bottom of the view, depending on the toolbar location (set using the xref:configure/editor-appearance.adoc#toolbar_location[`toolbar_location` option]).

For information on the `toolbar_sticky_offset` option, see: xref:configure/editor-appearance.adoc#toolbar_sticky_offset[User interface options - toolbar_sticky_offset].

=== Enhanced UI rendering performance

The User Interface has been profiled to find performance bottlenecks and a number of improvements have been made to increase the rendering speed. {productname} 5.9 should now be up to 20% faster at rendering the UI components, which also leads to an improved editor initialization time.

=== Additional enhancements

{productname} 5.9 introduces the following minor enhancements:

* Fancy menu items now accept an `initData` property to allow custom initialization data.
* Improved the load time of the `fullpage` plugin by using the existing editor schema rather than creating a new one.
* `Env.browser` now uses the User-Agent Client Hints API where it is available.
* Icons with a `-rtl` suffix in their name will now automatically be used when the UI is rendered in right-to-left mode.
* The `formatter.match` API now accepts an optional `similar` parameter to check if the format partially matches.
* The `formatter.formatChanged` API now supports providing format variables when listening for changes.
* The formatter will now fire `FormatApply` and `FormatRemove` events for the relevant actions.
* The `autolink` plugin link detection now permits custom protocols.
* The `autolink` plugin valid link detection has been improved.

[[functionalitychanges]]
== Functionality changes

The following functionality changes were made for the {productname} 5.9 release:

* Changed the load order so content CSS is loaded before the editor is populated with content.
* Changed the `emoticons`, `wordcount`, `code`, `codesample`, and `template` plugins to open dialogs using commands.
* The context toolbar will no longer show an arrow when it overlaps the content, such as in table cells.
* The context toolbar will no longer overlap the statusbar for toolbars using `node` or `selection` positions.

* More URLs can now be detected with the `smart_paste` option. Specifically, custom URL scheme detection is more accurate. For more information on URL schemes, see: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL#scheme[What is a URL - Scheme].

[[knownissues]]
== Known issues

This section describes issues that users of {productname} 5.9 may encounter and possible workarounds for these issues.

* xref:coreknownissues[Core known issues]
* xref:tablepluginknownissues[Table plugin known issues]
* xref:real-timecollaborationrtcknownissues[Real-time Collaboration (RTC) known issues]

[[coreknownissues]]
=== Core known issues

==== "Right-hand side of 'instanceof' is not callable" or "Event is not a function. (evaluating 'e instanceof Event')" exceptions

Issue:: This issue affects developers who have overridden the native browser `Event` window object, such as those seen in some Vue.js tutorials. This breaks the native `Event` API which TinyMCE 5.9 makes use of.

Solution::
Ensure that the `Event` window or global object is not overridden in your code. The cases reported to {companyname} use something similar to `window.Event = new Vue();`. This should be renamed to something that does not conflict with a browser API, such as `window.EventBus = new Vue();`.
{companyname} highly recommends against overriding any built-in browser APIs, as the editor relies on built-in browser API behavior to function as expected.

[[tablepluginknownissues]]
=== Table plugin known issues

==== The new table color map settings do not apply to color pickers in the table dialogs

Issue:: This issue affects the new `table_background_color_map` and `table_border_color_map` options. Setting these options will change the set of colors used in their respective toolbar buttons and menu items, but not the table dialog.

Workaround:: There was no known workaround at the time of the release.

==== Issues with the new _Table Column Header_ and _Table Row Header_ toolbar buttons and menu items

Issue:: This issue affects users of the new `tablecolheader` and `tablerowheader` toolbar buttons and menu items. Toggling off column or row headers may result in a cell being converted into a normal cell when still part of a header row or column.

Workaround:: There was no known workaround at the time of the release.

[[real-timecollaborationrtcknownissues]]
=== Real-time Collaboration (RTC) known issues

==== Users are unable to add content below an Horizontal Rule (`hr`) if inserted on the last line

Issue:: If an `hr` is inserted at the end of the editor content, placing the cursor below it overwrites the `hr`.

Workaround:: There was no known workaround at the time of the release.

==== Circumstances where users are unable to clear content formatting

Issue:: The clear formatting feature only works with a selection across the text to be cleared.

Workaround:: There was no known workaround at the time of the release.

==== Possibility of inconsistent undo operations

Issue:: After adding content locally, when remote users edit that same content, local undo might not work or might remove more text than expected. This will not remove remote content.

Workaround:: There was no known workaround at the time of the release.

==== Inconsistent editor scrolling behavior when multiple users are editing various areas of a document

Issue:: When the caret is not visible, remote changes might scroll the editor to make the caret visible.

Workaround:: There was no known workaround at the time of the release.

==== Connection issues may occur when users delete large sections of content while multiple users are editing

Issue:: Deleting large sections of content (either deliberately or using undo) may result in a disconnection from the server.

Workaround:: There was no known workaround at the time of the release.

==== Errors and warnings present in the JavaScript developer console

Issue:: Several errors and warnings may be shown in the developer console (for example, opening some format menus).

Workaround:: There was no known workaround at the time of the release.

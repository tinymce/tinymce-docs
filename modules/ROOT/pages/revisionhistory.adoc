The {pluginname} plugin offers users the ability to view document changes over time and restore previous versions effortlessly.

== How it works

The {pluginname} view is accessible via either the `revisionhistory` toolbar button or menu button within the `View` menu.

The key components are:

1. In the {pluginname} view header, there are two buttons.
* `Restore this version`: Set the selected version's content to the editor and close the view.
* `Close`: Close the view.

2. The readonly diff view presents the changes between the selected version and its immediate predecessor, clearly highlighting for easy recognition. The changes are also color-coded for clarity:
* Red: Removed content.
* Green: New content.
* Yellow: Content being modified. Modifications to HTML content implies attributes or formatting (e.g. bold, italic, etc.).
3. The revisions sidebar displays all available document versions. When a new version is selected, the diff view is updated accordingly.

[NOTE]
The default highlighting colors can be customized using the xref:revisionhistory_css_url[`+revisionhistory_css_url+`] option.

[NOTE]
The {pluginname} plugin interprets commented HTML as valid content, yet it disregards this content during the version comparison process. Consequently, a version containing solely commented content appears as empty in the user interface displaying the differential content.

== Basic setup

To setup the {pluginname} plugin user-interface in the editor:

* add `{plugincode}` to the `plugins` option in the editor configuration;
* add `{plugincode}` to the `toolbar` option in the editor configuration;
* add `{plugincode}_fetch` option to the editor configuration;

For example:

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  plugins: 'revisionhistory',
  toolbar: 'revisionhistory',
  // Required
  revisionhistory_fetch: () => new Promise((resolve) => {
    const revisions = [];  // Replace this with an API request to get saved versions
    resolve(revisions);
  })
});
----

== Understanding types of versions

There are three types of versions in {pluginname} plugin:

* Initial Version: This version is generated during the {productname} `Loaded` event, with the editor's initial content.
* Draft Version: This version is generated upon accessing the {pluginname}, reflecting the editor's current content. When included, it becomes the `latest version` and is placed at the top of the revisions list. Note that the draft version is not a saved version.
* Saved Versions: These versions are saved in the client's storage and are displayed in the revisions list. They are fetched upon opening the {pluginname} view using the `revisionhistory_fetch` and `revisionhistory_fetch_revision` options.

When dealing with a new document that has no saved versions, the {pluginname} plugin will typically maintain two versions: the `initial` and `draft` versions.

For documents with saved versions, the `initial` version is disregarded by the {pluginname} plugin, assuming it's already part of the version history.

If there are no changes to the content of the editor since initialization, the `initial` version is not displayed in the revisions list since it's identical to the `draft` version.

The table below summarizes how versions are handled in the {pluginname}:

[cols="1,1,1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Has Initial Version | Draft Version | Has Saved Versions | Expectation
| No                  | N/A           | No                 | No versions are shown
| No                  | N/A           | Yes                | Only the saved versions are shown
| Yes                 | N/A           | No                 | Only the draft version is shown
| Yes                 | Different     | No                 | Both the initial and draft versions are shown
| Yes                 | N/A           | Yes                | The saved versions and the draft version are shown

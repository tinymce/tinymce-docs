The {pluginname} plugin offers users the ability to view document changes over time and restore previous versions effortlessly.

== How it works

The {pluginname} view is accessible via either the `revisionhistory` toolbar button or menu button within the `View` menu.

The key components are:

1. In the toolbar header, there are two buttons.
* `Restore this version`: Set the selected version's content to the editor and close the view.
* `Close`: Exit the view.

2. The readonly diff view presents the changes between the selected version and its immediate predecessor, clearly highlighting for easy recognition. The changes are also color-coded for clarity:
* Red: Removed content
* Green: New content
* Yellow: Content being modified. Modifications to HTML content implies attribute or format changes (bold, italic, etc)
3. The revisions sidebar displays all available document versions. When a new version is selected, the diff view is updated accordingly.

[NOTE]
The default highlighting colors can be customized using the xref:revisionhistory_css_url[`+revisionhistory_css_url+`] option.

[NOTE]
The {pluginname} plugin interprets commented HTML as valid content, yet it disregards this content during the version comparison process. Consequently, a version containing solely commented content appears as empty in the user interface displaying the differential content.

== Basic setup

To setup the {pluginname} plugin user-interface in the editor:

* add `{plugincode}` to the `plugins` option in the editor configuration;
* add `{plugincode}` to the `toolbar` option in the editor configuration;
* add `{plugincode}_fetch` option to the editor configuration;

For example:

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  plugins: 'revisionhistory',
  toolbar: 'revisionhistory',
  // Required
  revisionhistory_fetch: () => new Promise((resolve) => {
    const revisions = [];  // Replace this with an API request to get saved versions
    resolve(revisions);
  })
});
----

== Understanding initial and current versions

When dealing with a new document, that has no saved versions, {pluginname} plugin will always typically maintain two versions: the `initial` and `current` version.

* Initial Version: this version is generated during the {productname} `Loaded` event, with the editor's content initialized.
* Current Version: is added on opening the {pluginname} with the editor's current content. If included, it will become the `latest version` and placed at the top of the revisions list.

[TIP]
If both versions are the same, only the `current version` is kept.

For documents with saved versions, the `initial version` is disregarded by the {pluginname} assuming it's already part of the version history. The current version is only discarded if it matches the closest saved version.

The below table summaries how the initial and current versions are handled in the {pluginname}:

[cols="1,1,1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Initial Version |Different Current Version |Has Saved Versions |Expect
|No |No |No |No versions are shown
|Yes |No |No |Only the current version is shown
|Yes |Yes |No |Both the initial and current versions are shown
|Yes |Yes |Yes |The saved versions and the current version are shown
|Yes |No |Yes |The saved versions and the current version are shown
|No |Yes |Yes |The saved versions and the current version are shown
|No |No |Yes |Only the saved versions are shown
|===

[NOTE]
`Different current version` implies whether the current version is different than the initial version. When the editor is initialized with content, the two versions are the same.

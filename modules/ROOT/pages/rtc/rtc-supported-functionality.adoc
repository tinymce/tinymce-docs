== Integration considerations

When planning to integrate Real-time Collaboration into your application or website, consider the following details and how they impact your use-case. If you are in doubt, don't hesitate to link:{contactpage}[contact us] and discuss your requirements.

* Do not load content into {productname} that was created using a plugin not yet supported in RTC, such as: Tables, Media embed, Checklist, or Table of contents. Without the plugin enabled to protect the relevant content, you risk making changes to the HTML in a way it's no longer recognized by the plugin.
* If content is created in an RTC session, then updated outside of an _RTC-enabled_ {productname} editor, a new document ID (`documentId`) is needed for subsequent RTC sessions. The RTC plugin does not currently provide APIs for updating the content programmatically. If your use-case requires you to update the content outside of the RTC clients, your server will need to generate a new document ID and distribute it to all collaborators and block or otherwise prevent editing or collaborating with the old document ID.
* Using the RTC plugin in hybrid mode is not supported and not recommended. Self-hosted versions of {productname} should not be used with the cloud version of the RTC plugin. The RTC plugin is dependent on the {productname} version it is released with. When using {productname} for the {cloudname}, {productname} will use the linked version of the RTC plugin.

:title_nav: Text Pattern

The Text Pattern plugin matches special patterns in the text and applies formats, replaces text, or executes commands on these patterns.

The default pattern is similar to markdown syntax, so the user can type `# text` to produce a header or `+**text**+` to make text *bold*.

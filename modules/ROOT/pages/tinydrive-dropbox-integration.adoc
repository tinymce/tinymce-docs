{cloudfilemanager} enables you to import files from any Dropbox account if you set up the Dropbox integration by providing a Dropbox app key. When the user selects a file from Dropbox, it will instantly be uploaded or imported into the {cloudfilemanager} storage so that it can be viewed online and shared through {cloudfilemanager}.

== Prerequisites

A valid Dropbox user account is required for integrating Dropbox with {cloudfilemanager}. Refer to https://help.dropbox.com/account/create-account[this] link for more information on creating a Dropbox user account.

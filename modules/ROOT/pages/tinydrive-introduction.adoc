== Upload files URL

The URL format for each file is `+https://drive.tiny.cloud/1/{your-api-key}/{uuid}+`, and is generated when a file is uploaded. If a file is moved or renamed, it will still have the same unique URL, so the restructuring of the files using {cloudfilemanager} won't affect the URL. Deleting a file will mark the URL as being unused, and the URL will not continue to work.

== JSON Web Token (JWT) based authentication

Some {companyname} services require setting up JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication. This allows the {cloudname} to verify that the end users are allowed to access a particular feature. JWT is a common authorization solution for web services and is documented in detail on the https://jwt.io/ website. For information on setting up JWT authentication, see the xref:tinydrive-jwt-authentication.adoc[JWT authentication section].

== User specific file access

{cloudfilemanager} allows developers to set user-specific directories, so users can only see their own files. This can be done by setting the `+https://claims.tiny.cloud/drive/root+` custom JSON Web Token (JWT) claim to a path within {accountpage}. This path will automatically be constructed when the user is accessing {cloudfilemanager} using a JWT key with that claim. The user can only see and manage files within that directory.

== Security and performance

{companyname} is aware that security is a primary concern when it comes to cloud storage. As a user's assets are passed between {cloudfilemanager} and the {cloudname}, {cloudfilemanager} uses the {accountpage} API key and a JSON Web Token (JWT) to authenticate each data transaction.

== File types

There is a fixed set of file extensions (formats) that can be uploaded, and these are placed in the file type categories below. Some file formats are blocked as they can be a security issue.

== Understanding editor loads for {productname}

[IMPORTANT]
This information is only relevant to Tiny Cloud users. Users who self-host the open source version of {productname} are not subject to editor load restrictions, but must comply with the https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/blob/master/LICENSE.TXT[open source license]. 

An editor load is the event that occurs each time {productname} is initialized in your application. The editor dispatches the 'init' event to indicate a successful load. For example, if 100 users load {productname} 10 times each, the result would be 1,000 editor loads. 

The process of initializing an editor involves several steps.

. The integrator initializes one or more editors on the webpage, commonly accomplished through the `tinymce.init({ ... })` method. 
+
Regardless of the method used, the following pattern is adhered to when adding an editor to a webpage:
+
.. Create a new editor instance object.
.. Add the editor instance to the editor manager.
.. Call `editor.render()`.

. Calling `editor.render()` triggers a sequence of functions that prepare the editor for user interaction. Notably:
+
.. All required scripts, including theme, model, language, icons, skin, and plugins, are loaded and initialized.
.. The editor UI is rendered.
.. The target element on the webpage is transformed into an editor instance.
.. Content CSS is loaded onto the page.
.. Initial content is loaded into the editor from the target element.

. If all these steps are successful, the final initialization steps are completed, including:
+
.. Setting the `editor.initialized` property to `true`.
.. Dispatching the `init` event.
.. Marking the editor as the active editor in the editor manager.
.. Setting the selection to a valid position in the editor and making it focused so the user can interact with it.

**The 'init' event serves as the conclusive indicator that the editor has completed its loading process**. At this point, the editor has been successfully initialized and is ready for user interaction. 

== How are editor loads counted?

An editor load is counted **each time {productname} is initialized on the page**. 

== What happens if I have multiple editors on a page?

Each individual editor instance on a page is counted as one editor load. For example, if a page has ten editors, a single refresh of that page results in ten editor loads.

== What can contribute to a high number of editor loads?

The most obvious scenario is using multiple editors on a single page (see above). For example:

* An email building app that has a {productname} editor embedded in multiple sections
* A publicly available page on a high traffic website with multiple editor instances

== How can I get unlimited editor loads?

You can get unlimited editors loads one of three ways:

* The open-source version of {productname} can be self hosted, and is not subject to editor load restrictions.
* The open-source version of {productname} is also available via third party-hosted CDNs and is not subject to editor load restrictions.

== I have an annual plan. Are my editor loads calculated monthly or over the entire year?

If you have an annual plan, your editor loads are calculated on a monthly basis within the structure of your annual plan. Similar to our monthly plans, you have a set monthly editor load limit and are automatically charged $40 USD per every block of 1,000 editor loads over the plan limit.

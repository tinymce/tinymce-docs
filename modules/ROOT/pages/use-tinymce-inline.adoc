{productname} has three main integration modes: a _classic_ full editor mode, an _inline_ editing mode, and a distraction-free mode.

The inline editing mode is used for merging the editing and reading views of the page for a seamless editing experience and true WYSIWYG behavior.

Inline editing mode does not replace the selected element with an iframe, but instead edits the element's content in-place. Inline editors are designed:

* To be "hidden" until the editable content is selected,
* To use the CSS stylesheet of the page where it initializes, and
* To have minimal UI around the content area to minimize the area occupied by the editor.

== Enabling inline editing mode

Inline mode only works on content within a block element (such as: `+div+` or `+h1+`). To enable inline mode, set the `+inline+` option to `+true+`. For example:

[source,html,subs="attributes+"]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <script src="{cdnurl}" referrerpolicy="origin"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript">
  tinymce.init({
    selector: '#myeditablediv',
    inline: true
  });
  </script>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>{productname} Inline Editing Mode Guide</h1>
  <form method="post">
    <div id="myeditablediv">Click here to edit!</div>
  </form>
</body>
</html>
----

The following demonstration is using four {productname} editors in inline mode, two for the headings, and two for the body text.

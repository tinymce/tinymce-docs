. Run Webpack to test the bundle, such as:
+
[source,sh]
----
webpack --config webpack.config.js
----
+
If Webpack runs successfully, check that the editor loads in the application. If Webpack fails, review any errors and review the configuration changes in this procedure; you may need to adjust for conflicts or other issues when bundling {productname} into an existing project.

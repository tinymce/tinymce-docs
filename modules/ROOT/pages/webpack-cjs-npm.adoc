. Run Webpack to test the bundle, such as:

[source, sh]
----
 webpack --config webpack.config.js
----
+
If Webpack runs successfully, check that the editor loads in the application.
 If Webpack fails, review any errors and review the configuration changes in this procedure; you may need to adjust for conflicts or other issues when bundling {productname} into an existing project.

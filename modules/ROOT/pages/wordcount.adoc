:plugincode: wordcount

The {pluginname} plugin adds functionality for counting words to the {productname} editor.

When loaded the {pluginname} plugin:

* places a word and character counter in the status bar.
** By default the counter appears adjacent the **Powered by Tiny** xref:statusbar-configuration-options.adoc#branding[product attribution logo].
** Clicking the counter in the status bar switches the display between word count and character count.
* adds a **Word count** command to the **Tools** menu.
** choosing this command presents a **Word Count** dialog showing the word and character count for the current document. If there is a current selection, the word and character count for the selection is also shown.
** if `wordcount` is also added to the toolbar configuration, a **Word Count** toolbar item presents that functions equivalently to the **Tools → Word count** menu command.

== Word count logic

The Word count plugin counts ‘words’ by delimiting strings at pre-defined word boundaries.

=== Word boundary characers

==== Some characters treated as word boundaries

[cols'"1,1']
|===
|Name |Example and notes

|Space
|This includes space character entities such as `+&nbsp;+` (the non-breaking space character entity) and `+&thinsp;+` (the thin space character entity).
|Em-dashes
|**—**

|En-dashes
|**–**

|Question marks
|**?**

|Commas
|**,**

|Semi-colons
|**;**

|Exclamation marks
|**!**

|Solidus (aka forward slash)
|**/**

|Circumflex
|**^**

|Numero sign
|**№**

|Tilde
|**~**

|Plus sign
|**+**

|Vertical bar (aka pipe character)
|**\|**

|Dollar sign
|**$**

|Grave accent
|**`**

==== Some characters not treated as word boundaries

[cols'"1,1']
|===
|Name |Example and notes

|Hyphens
|**-**

|Fraction slash
|**⁄**

|Equals sign
|**=**

|Full-stops (aka periods)
|**.**

Note that space characters are word boundaries.

Practically speaking, it is full-stops embedded between letters without a space either side that don’t function as word boundary characters.

|Colons
|**:**

Note that space characters are word boundaries.

Practically speaking, it is colons embedded between letters without a space either side that don’t function as word boundary characters.

|Empty block elements
|`+<p></p>+`

Also, space characters inside otherwise empty elements — for example `+<p>&nbsp;</p>+` — do not change either the word or character count.

== Character count logic

The {pluginname} plugin counts glyphs.

The {pluginname} plugin does not count characters added for document management purposes.

Consider an end-user enters the following:

[source,text]
----
1↵
↵
2↵
↵
----

That is, they enter a numeric one, followed by two hard returns, and then a numeric two, followed by a further two hard returns.

By default, {productname} stores this entered data as follows:

[source,html]
----
<p>1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
----

The character count for this data is **2**.

The {pluginname} does not add either of the `+&nbsp;+` characters placed by {productname} to the document character count.

== Basic setup

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  plugins: 'wordcount',
  toolbar: 'wordcount'
});

== Commands

The {pluginname} plugin provides the following {productname} command.

include::partial$commands/wordcount-cmds.adoc[]

== API

The Word Count plugin exposes an API for retrieving the word and character count of either the whole document or the current editor selection. Following is an example of how to retrieve each property.

=== Example: using the `+wordcount+` plugin APIs

[source,js]
----
const wordcount = tinymce.activeEditor.plugins.wordcount;

console.log(wordcount.body.getWordCount());
console.log(wordcount.body.getCharacterCount());
console.log(wordcount.body.getCharacterCountWithoutSpaces());

console.log(wordcount.selection.getWordCount());
console.log(wordcount.selection.getCharacterCount());
console.log(wordcount.selection.getCharacterCountWithoutSpaces());

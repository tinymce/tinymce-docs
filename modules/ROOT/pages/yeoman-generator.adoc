{companyname} maintains a link:https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/advanced/yeoman-generator/[Yeoman generator] to assist with creating plugins for {productname}. The Yeoman Generator will create the files and boilerplate code required for a custom plugin, and sets up some helpful commands.

== Install the generator

The plugin generator is built with the project scaffolding tool http://yeoman.io/[Yeoman]. To get started install both `+yo+` (the yeoman command) and the generator with the following command:

[source,sh]
----
npm install --global yo generator-tinymce
----

Wait for the install to finish.

== Run the generator

Start the generator with the following command:

[source,sh]
----
yo tinymce
----

You will then be guided through these questions:

. *Plugin name:* The name of the plugin.
. *Plugin description (optional):* An optional description of the plugin.
. *Initialize git repo?* Here you can skip the creation of a new repository for the plugin.
. *What’s your name?* For license.
. *Your email (optional):* For license.
. *Your website (optional):* For license.
. *Which license do you want to use?* Choose the license for the plugin.

Yeoman installs the needed dependencies, and the project is bootstrapped and ready. `+cd+` into the plugin directory and run the following command to start the auto-reloading development server:

[source,sh]
----
npm start
----

== Create distribution ready build

Run the following command once you have completed development of the plugin:

[source,sh]
----
yarn build
----

A `+dist+` directory will be created, containing a sub-directory with the same name as the plugin. The sub-directory will contain the following files:

* `+plugin.js+` - unminified plugin bundle
* `+plugin.min.js+` - minified and uglified plugin bundle
* `+CHANGELOG.txt+` - the text file containing your changes
* `+LICENSE.txt+` - the text file containing your license
* `+version.txt+` - the text file containing the version of your plugin

For example, `+yarn build+` will generate the following output for a plugin named `+my_plugin+`:

[source,sh]
----
dist/
└── my_plugin/
    ├── CHANGELOG.txt
    ├── LICENSE.txt
    ├── plugin.js
    ├── plugin.min.js
    └── version.txt

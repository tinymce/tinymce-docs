{companyname} maintains a xref:yeoman-generator.adoc[Yeoman generator] to assist with creating plugins for {productname}. The Yeoman Generator will create the files and boilerplate code required for a custom plugin, and sets up some helpful commands.

== Install the generator

The plugin generator is built with the project scaffolding tool http://yeoman.io/[Yeoman]. To get started install both `yo` (the yeoman command) and the generator with the following command:

[source, sh]
----
npm install --global yo generator-tinymce
----

Wait for the install to finish.

== Run the generator

Start the generator with the following command:

[source, sh]
----
yo tinymce
----

You will then be guided through these questions:

. *Plugin name:*
The name of the plugin.
. *Plugin description (optional):*
An optional description of the plugin.
. *Initialize git repo?*
Here you can skip the creation of a new repository for the plugin.
. *What's your name?*
For license.
. *Your email (optional):*
For license.
. *Your website (optional):*
For license.
. *Which license do you want to use?*
Choose the license for the plugin.

Yeoman installs the needed dependencies, and the project is bootstrapped and ready. `cd` into the plugin directory and run the following command to start the auto-reloading development server:

[source, sh]
----
npm start
----

== Create distribution ready build

Run the following command once you have completed development of the plugin:

[source, sh]
----
yarn build
----

A `dist` directory will be created, containing a sub-directory with the same name as the plugin. The sub-directory will contain the following files:

* `plugin.js` - unminified plugin bundle
* `plugin.min.js` - minified and uglified plugin bundle
* `CHANGELOG.txt` - the text file containing your changes
* `LICENSE.txt` - the text file containing your license
* `version.txt` - the text file containing the version of your plugin

For example, `yarn build` will generate the following output for a plugin named `my_plugin`:

[source, sh]
----
dist/
└── my_plugin/
    ├── CHANGELOG.txt
    ├── LICENSE.txt
    ├── plugin.js
    ├── plugin.min.js
    └── version.txt

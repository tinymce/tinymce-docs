== Configuration Steps

=== Add Your API Key

* Replace `YOUR-API-KEY` in both files with your actual {productname} API key
* The API key should be the same in both the HTML script source and the JWT payload

=== Add Your Private Key

* Replace the private key placeholder in `jwt.js` with your actual private key
* Make sure it's in `PKCS8` format
* Keep this key secure and never share it publicly

=== Running Your Project

. Start the server:
+
[source,bash]
----
node jwt.js
----

. Open your browser to: `http://localhost:3000`
. You should see:
* The {productname} editor
* An "{pluginname}" button in the toolbar

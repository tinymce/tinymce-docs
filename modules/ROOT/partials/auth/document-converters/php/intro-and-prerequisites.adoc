== Introduction

{pluginname} requires setting up JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication to maintain control over file security. A JWT endpoint generates and provides authorization tokens that verify submitted content is sent by authorized users, preventing unauthorized access. As a standard web services authorization solution, JWT is documented extensively at link:https://jwt.io/[https://jwt.io/].

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough for integrating {pluginname} with {productname}, including {pluginname} functionality, by using a PHP server for JWT token generation. It covers project setup, server configuration, and {productname} customization.

== What You'll Build

Before diving into the technical details, here's what you'll achieve with this guide:

* A working {productname} editor running {pluginname} plugin.
* A secure authentication system using JWT tokens
* A simple PHP server to handle the authentication

[TIP]
====
This guide is designed for developers new to JWT authentication and {productname} integration.

=== Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

* PHP installed on your computer
* OpenSSL installed on your computer
* Composer installed on your computer
* A {productname} API key (get one from link:https://www.tiny.cloud/signup[TinyMCE's website])
* Basic familiarity with the command line

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure you have your API key ready before starting. You'll need it for both the server and client configuration.

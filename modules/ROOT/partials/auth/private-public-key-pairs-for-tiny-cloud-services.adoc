The **{pluginname}** Server requires a _public_ key generated from the same _private_ key that will be used on your JSON Web Token (JWT) provider endpoint. The public key(s) stored on the {pluginname} Server are used to ensure that content is sent by authorized users.

There are two methods for generating and adding a public key to your API key:

. The secure key pair generator at link:{accountjwturl}[{accountpage} - JWT Keys] (recommended).
. Generate a key pair locally and add the _public_ key to link:{accountjwturl}[{accountpage} - JWT Keys].

== Generate a key pair using the {accountpage} JWT Keys page

The link:{accountjwturl}[{accountpage} - JWT Keys] page provides a private/public key generator, providing a quick and secure way of generating the required keys. This generator will store a copy of the _public_ key, and provide a downloadable file for both the public and private keys. {companyname} does **not store** the _private_ key and the key pair **cannot** be retrieved later.

== Generate a key pair locally

When generating a key pair locally, use one of the supported algorithms.
include::partial$auth/jwt-supported-algorithms.adoc[]

For instructions on generating a key pair locally, see: xref:generate-rsa-key-pairs.adoc[Creating a private/public key pair for Tiny Cloud].

ifeval::[{numberedHeading} == true]
= 2. Add a public key to the {cloudname} API key
endif::[]

ifeval::[{numberedHeading} != true]
== Add a public key to the {cloudname} API key
endif::[]

Once a public key has been generated, add the public key to the {cloudname} API key at: link:{accountjwturl}[{accountpage} - JWT Keys].

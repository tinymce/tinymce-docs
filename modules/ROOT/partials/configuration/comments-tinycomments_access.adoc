[[tinycomments-access]]
== `tinycomments_access`

*Type:* `+String+`

*Possible values:* `'comment'`

This option sets the editor to the readonly mode, while still allowing comments to be made. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
* When `tinycomments_access` is set to `comment`, the editor will automatically switch to xref:editor-important-options.adoc#readonly[Readonly Mode].

=== Comments with `tinycomments_access` set to `'comment'`

When `tinycomments_access` is set to `comment`, the editor will be in xref:editor-important-options.adoc#readonly[Readonly mode], but the comments will be in a **comment-only** mode. This means that users can add and delete comments, but they cannot edit the editor content.


.Example
[source,javascript]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  plugins: 'tinycomments',
  tinycomments_mode: 'embedded',
  toolbar: 'addcomment showcomments',
  tinycomments_access: 'comment'
});

=== Comments with `readonly` set to `true`

When not using the `tinycomments_access` option, the comments sidebar will have a different state depending on the use of the xref:editor-important-options.adoc#readonly[`readonly` option].

With neither xref:editor-important-options.adoc#readonly[Readonly mode] nor `tinycomments: "comment"` configured, both the editor and the comments sidebar will be in their default state. By default, comments can be both viewed and added, and the editor content is editable.

With xref:editor-important-options.adoc#readonly[Readonly mode] enabled, the comments sidebar will be in a **view-only** mode, meaning all comments can be viewed and navigated, but no new comments can be added. Also, in the **readonly** state, the editor will still not be editable.


.Example
[source,javascript]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  plugins: 'tinycomments',
  tinycomments_mode: 'embedded',
  toolbar: 'addcomment showcomments',
  readonly: true, // set the editor to read-only mode
});

[[convert_urls]]
== `convert_urls`

This option enables you to control whether {productname} is to be smart and restore URLs to their original values. URLs are automatically converted (messed up) by default because the browser's built-in logic works this way. There is no way to get the real URL unless you store it away. If you set this option to `+false+` it tries to keep these URLs intact. This option is set to `+true+` by default, which means URLs are forced to be either *absolute* or *relative* depending on the state of xref:url-handling.adoc#relative_urls[relative_urls].

*Type:* `+Boolean+`

*Possible values:* `+true+`, `+false+`

*Default value:* `+true+`

[[details_initial_state]]
== `details_initial_state`

This option sets the state of Accordion sections

* when they are created; and
* when they are already extant as an editor loads.

When set to `+collapsed+`, all Accordions will present as closed on creation and on the editor loading.

When set to `+expanded+`, all Accordions will present as open on creation and on the editor loading.

When set to `+inherited+`, Accordions preserve their individual state and present as open when created.

The default value for this option is `+inherited+`.

*Type:* `+String+`

*Possible values:* `+inherited+`, `+collapsed+`, `+expanded+`

*Default value:* `+inherited+`

=== Example: using `details_initial_state` to set all created Accordion sections to present as closed by default

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your html
  plugins: accordion
  details_initial_state: 'collapsed'
});
----

=== Example: using `details_initial_state` to set pre-configured `<details>` content in new {productname} documents to present as open

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  newdocument_content: '<details><summary>Accordion summary...</summary><p>Accordion body...</p></details>',
  details_initial_state: 'expanded',
});
----

NOTE
.Accordion plugin not required
====
The option does not require the xref:accordion.adoc[Accordion] plugin be loaded to come into effect.

In the above example, when *File â†’ New document* is selected, the xref:content-behavior-options#newdocument_content[`newdocument_content`] option puts a `<details>` element into the new editor instance and the `details_initial_state` option causes that element to present as open.

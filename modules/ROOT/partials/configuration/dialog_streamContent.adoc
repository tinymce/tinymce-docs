[[streamContent]]
== `streamContent`

`+streamContent+` is an optional property, available to add to the `+iframe+` dialog component.

The property has a default value of `+false+`.

When `+streamContent+` is set to `+true+`, content presented within the `+iframe+` dialog component is updated using the `document.write()` method, rather than by setting the `+srcdoc+` attribute.

Setting the `+srcdoc+` attribute causes the `+iframe+` to reload. This results in a visually jarring flickering effect in most modern browsers, particularly when content is rapidly updating.

As well, performing updates via the `+srcdoc+` attribute means the contents of the `+iframe+` are not accessible. As a consequence, it is not possible to automatically scroll the `+iframe+` contents to the bottom as it gets updated.

Setting `+streamContent+` to `+true+` minimises the flickering effect.

If the `+iframe+` component is already scrolled to the end, `streamContent: true` also keeps the view at this point. The UX is content being added to the `+iframe+` component as if it is being quickly typed in.

A user can, however, scroll through the `+iframe+` component as updates are being added. If the view is scrolled back to the end while updates are still being added, the `streamContent: true` setting will, again, keep the view at this point.

*Type:* `+Boolean+`

*Possible values:* `+true+` `+false+`

*Default value:* `false`

=== Example: setting an `iframe` component to display updating content using the `streamContent` property

[source,js]
----
tinymce.activeEditor.windowManager.open({
  title: 'Dialog Title', // The dialog's title - displayed in the dialog header
  size: 'normal',
  body: {
    type: 'panel', // The root body type - a Panel or TabPanel
    items: [ // A list of panel components
      {
        name: 'preview',
        type: 'iframe',
        streamContent: true
      }
    ]
    },
    buttons: [ // A list of footer buttons
      {
        type: 'submit',
        text: 'OK'
      }
    ]
}, { inline: 'bottom' } );
----

[NOTE]
.Dialog position
====
The example above also adds a second argument — `{ inline: 'bottom' } — to the dialog. This argument changes the presented position of the dialog within the {productname} editor.

For information on using this property see the xref:dialog-configuration.adoc#dialog-position[Dialog position] section of the xref:dialog-configuration.adoc[Dialog configuration documentation].

=== Recommended method for updating content in an `+iframe+` component

The recommended method for updating content in an `+iframe+` component is:

[source,js]
----
`onAction: (api) => api.setData({ myiframe: 'new content' })`
----

. This updates the iframe to contain the string `'new content'`. This text can be any valid html.

. `onAction` is a callback defined in the dialog spec. It is called when a button within the dialog `body` is triggered.

. `myiframe` is the name of the `+iframe+` component in this spec.

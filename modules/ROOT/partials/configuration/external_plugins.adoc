[[external_plugins]]
== `+external_plugins+`

This option allows you to specify a URL based location of plugins outside of the normal {productname} plugins directory.

{productname} will attempt to load these as per regular plugins when starting up. This option is useful when loading {productname} from a CDN or when you want to have the {productname} directory separate from your custom plugins.

This value should be set as a JavaScript object that contains a property for each {productname} plugin to be loaded. This property should be named after the plugin and should have a value that contains the location that the plugin that will be loaded from.

The URLs provided can be:

* *Absolute URLs*: Including the protocol, such as `+https://www.example.com/plugin.min.js+`.
* *Relative to the root directory of the web-server*: Including the leading "`+/+`" to indicate that it is relative to the web-server root, such as `+/plugin.min.js+`.
* *Relative to the {productname} `+base_url+`*: A relative path without the leading "`+/+`", such as `+../../myplugins/plugin.min.js+`. By default, the `+base_url+` is the directory containing {productname} javascript file (such as `+tinymce.min.js+`). For information on the `+base_url+` option, see: xref:editor-important-options.adoc#base_url[Integration and setup options - `+base_url+`].

Type : `+Object+`

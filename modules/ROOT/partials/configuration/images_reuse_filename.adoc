[[images_reuse_filename]]
== `+images_reuse_filename+`

By default {productname} will generate unique filename for each uploaded file (for details refer to xref:upload-images.adoc#image-uploader-requirements[Upload Images]). Sometimes this might have undesirable side-effects. For example, when `+automatic_uploads+` is enabled, every manipulation on the image done with the xref:editimage.adoc[Image Editing] plugin, results in file upload and each time under a different filename, despite the fact that the image stays the same.

Setting `+images_reuse_filename+` to _true_ tells {productname} to use the actual filename of the image, instead of generating a new one each time. Take into account that `+src+` attribute of the corresponding `+<img>+` tag gets replaced with whatever filename you send back from the server (see xref:file-image-upload.adoc#images_upload_url[images_upload_url]). It can be the same filename or something else, but the next time that filename is used for the upload.

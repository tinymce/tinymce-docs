[[images_upload_handler]]
== `+images_upload_handler+`

This option allows you to specify a function that is used to replace {productname}'s default JavaScript upload handler function with custom logic.

The upload handler function takes two arguments:

* `+blobInfo+`
* A `+progress+` callback that takes a value between 1 and 100.

and returns a https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise[Promise] that will resolve with the uploaded image URL or reject with an error. The error can be either a string or an object containing the following properties:

* `+message+` - The error message to display in the UI.
* `+remove+` - A flag to remove the image from the document, defaults to `+false+` if not set.

When this option is not set, {productname} utilizes an `+XMLHttpRequest+` to upload images one at a time to the server and resolves the `Promise` with the JSON `location` property for the remote image returned by the server.

*Type:* `+Function+`

[[init_content_sync]]
== `+init_content_sync+`

This option determines whether the iframe is initialized synchronously or asynchronously.

When disabled, the editor is initialized asynchronously using `srcdoc`, however this can occasionally cause the editor to flicker during initialization.

When enabled, the editor will be initialized using `document.write`, which can reduce this flickering, but some flicker could still occur, such as loading the content css.

*Type:* `+Boolean+`

*Default value:* `+false+`

=== Example: using `+init_content_sync+`

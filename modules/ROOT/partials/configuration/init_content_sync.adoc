[[init_content_sync]]
== `+init_content_sync+`

include::partial$misc/admon-requires-6.5v.adoc[]

This option determines whether the iframe is initialized synchronously or asynchronously.

When disabled, the editor is initialized asynchronously using `srcdoc`. This can, occasionally, cause the editor to flicker during initialization.

When enabled, the editor is initialized synchronously, using `document.write`. This can reduce flickering.

Flickering can still occur during synchronous initialization, however, such as when loading the content css.

NOTE: using the https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dynamic-markup-insertion.html#document.write()[`document.write`] method is https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/write[strongly discouraged].

*Type:* `+Boolean+`

*Default value:* `+false+`

=== Example: using `+init_content_sync+`

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  init_content_sync: 'true',
});
----

NOTE: When {productname} is running in xref:use-tinymce-inline.adoc[inline mode] (ie, when `+inline: true+` is set), setting `init_content_sync: true` has no effect.

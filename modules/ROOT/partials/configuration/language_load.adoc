[[language_load]]
== `+language_load+`

This option determines whether additional plugin or theme languages are loaded during {productname} editor initialization. By default, plugins which have support for languages other than English will automatically load the additional language packs.

*Type:* `+boolean+`

*Default value:* `+true+`

* When the `+language_load+` option is set to `+true+`, any available language packs can be loaded and used by {productname} and plugins that support multiple-languages.
* When set to `+false+`, only explicitly configured language packs will load.

[IMPORTANT]
Setting `+language_load+` option to `+false+` is not recommended unless loading local language packs.

=== Example: using `+language_load+`

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea', // Change this value according to your HTML
  language_load: true, // Disables the automatic loading of additional plugin and theme language files.
});
----

[TIP]
When bundling, it is advisable for plugins that support multiple languages to load the additional language packs separately. This ensures that all required languages are available for the editor.

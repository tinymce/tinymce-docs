[[language_url]]
== `+language_url+`

When using the xref:ui-localization.adoc#language[`+language+`] option to set the user interface language you can place language pack(s) in a directory other than the default. If you do this, however, you must add the `language_url` option to your configuration and set this option to a path pointing to the language file(s) location.

We recommend the path URL be relative to the root of your web application, i.e. beginning with the absolute path reference character `+/+`. It is best to avoid relying on application context for safe path resolution of language packs.

Also, the `+language+` option must also be set and must be set to the name of the language pack file being loaded.

*Type:* `+String+`

=== Example: using `+language_url+`


[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea', // change this value according to your HTML
  language_url: '/path/to/language/pack/fi.js', // path from the root of your web application — / — to the language pack(s)
  language: 'fi'  // the name of the language pack file
});

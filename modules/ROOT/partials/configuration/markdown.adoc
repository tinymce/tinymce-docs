[[markdown_symbols]]
== `markdown_symbols` option

The `markdown_symbols` option allows you to define `key/value` pairs where the `key` represents a symbol in your content and the `value` represents the replacement for that symbol.

*Type:* `+Object+`

*Default value:* The `+markdown_symbols+` object accepts the following key-value pairs by default currently:

[source, js]
----
{
  C: '©',
  TM: '™',
  R: '®'
}
----

=== Example: using `markdown_symbols`

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  markdown_symbols: {
    C: '©',
    TM: '™',
    R: '®'
  }
});
----

[NOTE]
Additionally, if the **Emoticons** plugin is enabled and properly set up, emojis surrounded by colons (:) will also be replaced. This feature allows for a broader range of replacements, including emojis represented by image files. For example, `:smile:` will be translated to the corresponding emoji, if configured.

[NOTE]
In {pluginname} content, it's important to enclose key symbols like `+"C"+` within parentheses, as in `+"(C)"+`, to ensure proper conversion; note that they are **case-sensitive**, so `+"(c)"+` _will not be transformed_.

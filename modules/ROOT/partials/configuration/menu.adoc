[[menu]]
== `menu`

This option allows you to specify which menus should appear on {productname}'s menu bar and the xref:advanced/available-menu-items/[items] that should appear within the menus themselves.

To specify the menus that should appear on {productname}'s menu bar, the menu option should be provided with a JavaScript object containing a property for each menu. These properties should contain a JavaScript object themselves with properties `title` and `items`.

The `title` property should contain a string with the name of the `menu`. The `items` field should contain a space separated list of the controls that should populate the `menu`.

If you would like to group these menu items, please insert a `|` pipe character between the menu items.

*Type:* `Object`

[[min_height]]
== min_height

This option allows you to set the minimum height that a user can stretch the entire TinyMCE interface (by grabbing the dragable area in the bottom right of the editor interface) when using the modern theme.

____
Note that this behavior is different than the link:/plugins/autoresize[`autoresize`] plugin, which controls the resizing of the editable area only, not the entire editor.

[[example]]
===== Example

`js
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  min_height: 100
});
`

____
Pro tip: if you set the option <<resize,`resize`>> to `false` the resize handle will be disabled and a user will not be able to resize the editor (by manual dragging).

[[min_width]]
== `+min_width+`

This option allows you to set the minimum width that a user can stretch the entire {productname} interface (by grabbing the dragable area in the bottom right of the editor interface) when using the modern theme.

NOTE: This behavior is different from the xref:autoresize.adoc[`+autoresize+`] plugin, which controls the resizing of the editable area only, not the entire editor.

Type : `+Number+`

=== Example: Using `+min_width+`

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  min_width: 400
});
----

NOTE: By default the xref:editor-size-options.adoc#resize[`+resize+`] handle does not allow horizontal dragging and giving this key a value will not result in an observable behavior.

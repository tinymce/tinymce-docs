[[min_width]]
== `min_width`

This option allows you to set the minimum width that a user can stretch the entire {productname} interface (by grabbing the dragable area in the bottom right of the editor interface) when using the modern theme.

NOTE: This behavior is different from the xref:plugins/opensource/autoresize/[`autoresize`] plugin, which controls the resizing of the editable area only, not the entire editor.

*Type:* `Number`

=== Example: Using `min_width`

[source, js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  min_width: 400
});
----

NOTE: By default the <<resize,`resize`>> handle does not allow horizontal dragging and giving this key a value will not result in an observable behavior.

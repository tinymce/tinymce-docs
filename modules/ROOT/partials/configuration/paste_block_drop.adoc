[#{plugincode}_block_drop]
== `{plugincode}_block_drop`

Due to browser limitations, it is not possible to filter content that is dragged and dropped into the editor. When `{plugincode}]_block_drop` is set to true the plugin will disable drag and dropping content into the editor. This prevents the unfiltered content from being introduced. Copy and paste is still enabled.

Default value : `+false+`

Possible values : `+true+`, `+false+`

=== Example: Using `{plugincode}_block_drop`

[source,js,subs="attributes+"]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  plugins: '{plugincode}',
  {plugincode}_block_drop: false
});

[[promotion]]
== `+promotion+`

{productname} 6.2 and later includes the `promotion` option. It controls the presentation or otherwise of a Tiny-specific promotion button.

*Type:* `+Boolean+`

*Default value:* `+true+` in Community self-hosted instances; otherwise `+false+`.

*Possible values:* `+true+`, `+false+`

See xref:editor-premium-upgrade-promotion.adoc#premium-upgrade-promotion-defaults[Premium upgrade promotion defaults] for details.

=== Example: using `+promotion+`

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: "textarea",  // change this value according to your HTML
  promotion: true
});
----

The *Upgrade* promotion appears in the unused corner of the {productname} menu bar. Consequently it does not appear if the menu bar is disabled.

NOTE: The distribution-specific defaults are not fixed. Someone running {productname} as part of a Premium plan can turn this option on. And someone running the Community distribution of {productname} as a self-hosted instance can turn this option off.

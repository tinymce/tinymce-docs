[[rtc_client_connected]]
=== `rtc_client_connected`

This option allows applications to show when a user enters the RTC session. When used in combination with xref:rtc_client_disconnected[`rtc_client_disconnected`], a user interface of connected users can be kept up to date.

Only one `rtc_client_connected` event will be fired per client connection. Connecting to a session with multiple existing clients will fire separate `rtc_client_connected` events for each existing client. If a user connects using two or more editors (such as on desktop and on mobile), a separate `rtc_client_connected` event will be fired.

To help with generating a user interface for connected users, an object for user details is provided by the xref:rtc_user_details_provider[`rtc_user_details_provider`] option.

[[rtc_server_disconnected]]
== `+rtc_server_disconnected+`

If the RTC session fails to connect, or is disconnected due to an error, the user will be blocked from editing (using xref:apis/tinymce.editor.adoc#setProgressState[setProgressState]) along with an error notification:

**RTC has lost connection to the server, please reload the page. More information may be available in the console.**

The `+rtc_server_disconnected+` callback can be used to provide an alternative response to this condition.

|Field |Type |Description
|`+reason+` | `+string+` | The cause of the disconnection. The value will be one of the reasons described below.
|`+message+` | `+string+` | A suggested description for the error, translated into the active user interface language, suitable for displaying to a user. This string may contain HTML, and in some cases is the same string displayed in the editor notification.

=== Reasons for disconnection

[CAUTION]
--
It is critical to at least handle the `+client_update_required+` reason. This indicates the RTC plugin in the current editor instance is out-of-date compared to other users on the session. The behavior in this scenario depends on the configuration:

* If the `+rtc_server_disconnected+` is set, no message is displayed to the user for this error. It is up to the integrator to manage cleanly reloading the page.
* If the `+rtc_server_disconnected+` is not set, the suggested error message will be displayed in a notification asking the user to reload the page.
--

The `+reason+` field will have one of the following values.

`+client_update_required+` : This error indicates the RTC plugin is out-of-date and cannot connect to an active session for the supplied `+rtc_document_id+`. This can happen on startup, but is more common at runtime during editor upgrades. The suggested message recommends the user reload the page.

`+encryption+` : Indicates a failure at startup either: in the cryptography process or the configured `+rtc_encryption_provider+` function. This may be caused by an error in the editor configuration.

`+jwt+` : Indicates a problem with the configured `+rtc_token_provider+` function. Either the provider returned a rejected promise, the returned object structure was incorrect, or the token was invalid.

`+content+` : Indicates a problem with the configured `+rtc_initial_content_provider+` function. Either the provider returned a rejected promise or the returned object structure was incorrect.

`+general+` : A generic error for reasons that do not yet have a category. Details will be printed to the browser console.

=== Example of handling server disconnection

tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea', // change this value according to your HTML
  plugins: 'rtc',
  rtc_document_id: 'unique-document-id',
  rtc_encryption_provider: () => Promise.resolve({ key: 'a secret key' }),
  rtc_token_provider: () => Promise.resolve({ token: 'signed-JWT-token' }),
  rtc_server_disconnected: ({ reason, message }) => {
    // perform some action in response to the RTC session disconnecting, such as:
    tinymce.activeEditor.notificationManager.open({
      text: 'Disconnected: ' + reason + '\n' + message,
      type: 'error'
    });
  }

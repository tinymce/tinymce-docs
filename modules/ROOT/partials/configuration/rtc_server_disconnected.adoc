=== `rtc_server_disconnected`

If the RTC session fails to connect, or is disconnected due to an error, the user will be blocked from editing (using xref:apis/tinymce.editor.adoc#setProgressState[setProgressState]) along with an error notification:

image:{baseurl}/images/icons/warning.svg[warning icon]*RTC has lost connection to the server, please reload the page. More information may be available in the console.*

The `rtc_server_disconnected` callback can be used to provide an alternative response to this condition.

==== Reasons for disconnection

CAUTION: It is critical to at least handle the `client_update_required` reason. This indicates the RTC plugin in the current editor instance is out-of-date compared to other users on the session. The behavior in this scenario depends on the configuration:
* If the `rtc_server_disconnected` is set, no message is displayed to the user for this error. It is up to the integrator to manage cleanly reloading the page.
* If the `rtc_server_disconnected` is not set, the suggested error message will be displayed in a notification asking the user to reload the page.

The `reason` field will have one of the following values.

`client_update_required`:: This error indicates the RTC plugin is out-of-date and cannot connect to an active session for the supplied `rtc_document_id`. This can happen on startup, but is more common at runtime during editor upgrades. The suggested message recommends the user reload the page.

`encryption`:: Indicates a failure at startup either: in the cryptography process or the configured `rtc_encryption_provider` function. This may be caused by an error in the editor configuration.

`jwt`:: Indicates a problem with the configured `rtc_token_provider` function. Either the provider returned a rejected promise, the returned object structure was incorrect, or the token was invalid.

`content`:: Indicates a problem with the configured `rtc_initial_content_provider` function. Either the provider returned a rejected promise or the returned object structure was incorrect.

`general`:: A generic error for reasons that do not yet have a category. Details will be printed to the browser console.

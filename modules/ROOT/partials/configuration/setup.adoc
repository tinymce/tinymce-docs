[[setup]]
== `+setup+`

This option allows a callback to be provided that will be executed before the {productname} editor instance is rendered.

To specify a setup callback, provide the `+setup+` option with a JavaScript function. This function should have one argument, which is a reference to the editor that is being set up.

A common use case for this setting is to add editor events to {productname}. For instance, if you would like to add a click event to {productname}, you would add it through the setup configuration setting.

*Type:* `+Function+`

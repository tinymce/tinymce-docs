This option allows you to specify the skin that TinyMCE should use. The default skin included with TinyMCE is named "lightgray".

*Type:* `String`

The name of the skin should match the name of the folder within the skins directory of TinyMCE. If the specified skin is not found, TinyMCE will not load.

`js
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  skin: "lightgray"
});
`

== `+table_merge_content_on_paste+`

include::partial$misc/admon-requires-6.5v.adoc[]

This option sets the behavior of the editor when a table is pasted into another table.

(If the insertion point is within a table or the current selection includes any part of a table, paste events happens into the table.)

When set to `+true+`, pasting a table into another table replaces the extant table with the pasted table. It merges the pasted table into the extant table, replacing the extant table in the process.

When set to `+false+`, pasting a table into another table creates a new table within the selected cell of the extant table.

The specific behavior, when this option is set to `+false+`, depends on the nature of the current selection.

. If there is no selection (ie the insertion point is within a cell), pasting a table in
  * pastes the table at the insertion point;
  * places material in the cell before the insertion point above the pasted-in table; and
  * places material in the cell after the insertion point below the pasted-in table.

. If the selection is the complete contents of a cell, pasting a table in
  * replaces those contents; and
  * puts the pasted-in table into the, now otherwise empty, table cell.

. If the selection is the complete contents of more than one cell, pasting a table in
  * replaces those contents;
  * puts the pasted-in table into the first selected cell; and
  * removes the other selected cells from the extant table.

. If the selection is the complete contents of more than one cell and the partial contents of a final cell, pasting a table in
  * replaces the contents of the completely selected cells;
  * places the pasted-in table in the first selected cell;
  * removes the other completely selected cells; and
  * leaves the partially selected cell unchanged.

This option is set to `+true+` by default.

*Type:* `+Boolean+`

*Possible values:* `+true+`, `+false+`

*Default value:* `+true+`

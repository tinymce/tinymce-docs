[[target]]
== `target`

Sometimes there might be already a reference to a DOM element at hand, for example when element is created dynamically. In such case initialising editor on it by xref:integration-and-setup.adoc#selector[selector] might seem irrational (since selector - _id_ or _class_ should be created first). In such cases you can supply that element directly via `target` option.

IMPORTANT: `selector` option has precedence over `target`, so in order for `target` to work, do not use the `selector` option.

*Type:* `Node`

=== Example: Using `target`

```js
var el = document.createElement('textarea');
document.body.appendChild(el);

// ...

tinymce.init({
  target: el
});
```

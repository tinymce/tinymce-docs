=== Text patterns and lists

As a consequence of

. `text_patterns` being moved to the core of {productname};
. `text_patterns` being turned on by default; and
. the set of `text_patterns` which are included by default

{productname} now includes both implicit and explicit list creation user interfaces. See xref:lists.adoc[Lists] for details and basic configuration examples.

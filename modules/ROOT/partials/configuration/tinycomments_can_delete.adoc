== `+tinycomments_can_delete+`

_Optional_ - This option sets the author permissions for _deleting comment conversations_. If the `+tinycomments_can_delete+` option is not included, the current author (`+tinycomments_author+`) cannot delete comment conversations created by other authors.

*Type:* `+Function+`

*Default value:*
[source,js]
----
(req, done, fail) => {
  const allowed = req.comments.length > 0 &&
                req.comments[0].author === <Current_tinycomments_author>;
  done({
    canDelete: allowed
  });
}
----

The following example extends the default behavior to allow the author `<Admin user>` to delete other author's comment conversations by adding `|| currentAuthor === '<Admin user>'`.

=== Example: Using `tinycomments_can_delete`

[source,js]
----
const currentAuthor = 'embedded_journalist';

tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your html
  plugins: 'tinycomments',
  tinycomments_mode: 'embedded',
  tinycomments_author: currentAuthor,
  tinycomments_can_delete: (req, done, fail) => {
    const allowed = req.comments.length > 0 &&
                  req.comments[0].author === currentAuthor;
    done({
      canDelete: allowed || currentAuthor === '<Admin user>'
    });
  }
});

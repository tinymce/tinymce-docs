== `+tinycomments_delete+`

The `+tinycomments_delete+` function should asynchronously return a flag indicating whether the comment thread was removed using the `+done+` callback. Unrecoverable errors are communicated to {productname} by calling the `+fail+` callback instead.

The `+tinycomments_delete+` function is passed a (`+req+`) object as the first parameter, which contains the following key-value pair:

* `+conversationUid+`: The uid of the conversation the reply is targeting.

The `+done+` callback should accept the following object:

[source,js]
----
{
  canDelete: boolean // whether or not the conversation can be deleted
  reason: string? // an optional string explaining why the delete was not allowed (if canDelete is false)
}
----

[NOTE]
Failure to delete due to permissions or business rules is indicated by "false", while unexpected errors should be indicated using the "fail" callback.

For example:

[source,js]
----
const delete_comment_thread = (ref, done, fail) => {
  const conversationUid = ref.conversationUid;
  fetch(`https://api.example/conversations/${conversationUid}`, {
    method: 'DELETE',
  }).then((response) => {
    if (response.ok) {
      done({ canDelete: true });
    } else if (response.status === 403) {
      done({ canDelete: false });
    } else {
      fail(new Error('Something has gone wrong...'));
    }
  });
}

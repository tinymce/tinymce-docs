== `+tinycomments_delete_all+`

The `+tinycomments_delete_all+` function should asynchronously return a flag indicating whether all the comment threads were removed using the `+done+` callback. Unrecoverable errors are communicated to {productname} by calling the `+fail+` callback instead.

The `+tinycomments_delete_all+` function is given a request (req) object as the first parameter with no fields.

The `+done+` callback should accept the following object:

[source,js]
----
{
  canDelete: boolean, // whether or not all conversations can be deleted
  reason: string? // an optional string explaining why the deleteAll was not allowed (if canDelete is false)
}
----

[NOTE]
Failure to delete due to permissions or business rules should be indicated by `+canDelete: false+`, while unexpected errors should be indicated using the `+fail+` callback.

.For example:
[source,js]
----
const delete_all_comment_threads = (_req, done, fail) => {
  fetch('https://api.example/conversations', {
    method: 'DELETE',
  }).then((response) => {
    if (response.ok) {
      done({ canDelete: true });
    } else if (response.status === 403) {
      done({ canDelete: false });
    } else {
      fail(new Error('Something has gone wrong...'));
    }
  });
}

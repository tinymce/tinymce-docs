[[tinycomments_resolve]]
== `+tinycomments_resolve+`

This option adds a _Resolve Conversation_ item to the dropdown menu of the first comment in a conversation.

The `+tinycomments_resolve+` function should asynchronously return a flag indicating whether the comment thread was resolved using the `+done+` callback. Unrecoverable errors are communicated to {productname} by calling the `+fail+` callback instead.

The `+tinycomments_resolve+` function is passed a (`+req+`) object as the first parameter, which contains the following key-value pair:

* `+conversationUid+`: The uid of the targeting conversation

The `+done+` callback should accept the following object:

[source,js]
----
{
  canResolve: boolean // whether or not the conversation can be resolved
  reason?: string // an optional string explaining why resolving was not allowed (if canResolve is false)
}
----

[NOTE]
Failure to resolve due to permissions or business rules should be indicated by `+canResolve: false+`, while unexpected errors should be indicated using the `+fail+` callback.

.For example:
[source,js]
----
const resolve_comment_thread = (ref, done, fail) => {
  const conversationUid = ref.conversationUid;
  fetch(`https://api.example/conversations/${conversationUid}`, {
    method: 'PUT',
  }).then((response) => {
    if (response.ok) {
      done({ canResolve: true });
    } else if (response.status === 403) {
      done({ canResolve: false });
    } else {
      fail(new Error('Something has gone wrong...'));
    }
  });
}

[[tinydrive_upload_path]]
== `+tinydrive_upload_path+`

This option sets the default upload path for files:

* Pasted into the editor,
* Uploaded to the editor through the Image dialog, or
* Dragged and dropped into the editor.

It will produce a date-based structure within this path, such as: `+/uploads/{year}{month}{day}+`. This is to avoid having thousands of files in the same directory.

Type : `+String+`

*Default value:* `+"/uploads"+`

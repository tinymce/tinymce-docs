[[uploadcare-cdn-base-url]]
== `uploadcare_cdn_base_url`

Specifies the domain used for the Uploadcare service. This domain determines where your files are uploaded and accessed. By default, the plugin uses the Uploadcare CDN `ucarecdn.com` to host and deliver your files. If you use a custom domain, update this option to match your configuration.

*Type:* `+String+`

*Default:* `+ucarecdn.com+`

[[uploadcare-public-key]]
== `uploadcare_public_key`

Defines the public API key required to authenticate and interact with the Uploadcare API. This key identifies your account and ensures that uploads and operations are associated with your project. Without setting this key, the Uploadcare integration will not function.

[IMPORTANT]
This option is mandatory for using Uploadcare.

*Type:* `+String+`

tinymce.init({
  selector: "textarea",
  plugins: 'uploadcare',
  toolbar: 'uploadcare',
  uploadcare_public_key: '<your-public-key>',
});
----

[[uploadcare-signature-provider]]
== `uploadcare_signature_provider`

Specifies a function used to generate secure signatures for authenticated requests to Uploadcare. This is necessary when using secure Uploadcare features, such as signed uploads or private storage. The function should return a `Promise` that resolves with an object containing the signature and expiration timestamp.

Use this option if you want to ensure secure uploads or restrict file access using Uploadcare's signed uploads feature.

*Type:* `+Function+`

=== Example: Setting `uploadcare_signature_provider`

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: "textarea",
  plugins: 'uploadcare',
  toolbar: 'uploadcare',
  uploadcare_public_key: '<your-public-key>',
  uploadcare_signature_provider: (_publicKey) => Promise.resolve({ signature: 'sig', expire: 123 }),
});
----

[[uploadcare-srcset-steps]]
== `uploadcare_srcset_steps`

Defines an array of numeric values representing the widths for responsive images. These widths are used to generate the `srcset` attribute for images, allowing browsers to select the most appropriate resolution based on the device's display and network conditions.

Customize this array to include only the widths you need for your application. For example, you can reduce the number of resolutions for faster processing or add specific sizes required for your layout.

*Type:* `+Array+`

*Default:* `+[100, 200, 300, 500, 750, 1000, 1250, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000]+`

=== Example: Customizing `uploadcare_srcset_steps`

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',
  plugins: 'uploadcare',
  toolbar: 'uploadcare',
  uploadcare_public_key: '<your-public-key>',
  uploadcare_srcset_steps: [100, 200, 300, 500],
});
----

[[uploadcare-store-type]]
== `uploadcare_store_type`

Specifies the storage type for uploaded files. Use this option to control whether files are stored temporarily or permanently, or allow Uploadcare to decide automatically based on your account settings.

* `auto`: Default behavior; Uploadcare decides the storage type.
* `temporary`: Files are stored temporarily and will expire after a certain period.
* `permanent`: Files are stored permanently in your Uploadcare account.

Select the appropriate value based on your application's requirements, such as whether files should persist for long-term use or be available for a limited time.

*Type:* `+String+`

*Default:* `permanent`

*Possible values:* `auto`, `temporary`, `permanent`

=== Example: Using `uploadcare_store_type`

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: "textarea",
  plugins: 'uploadcare',
  toolbar: 'uploadcare',
  uploadcare_public_key: '<your-public-key>',
  uploadcare_store_type: 'permanent',
});

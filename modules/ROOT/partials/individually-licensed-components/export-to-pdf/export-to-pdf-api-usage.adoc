== API Usage

The {pluginname} On-Premises converter provides the ability to convert an HTML document to a PDF file via Restful API.

The API is available on `+http://localhost:[port]+` (by default the `port` is `8080`).

[NOTE]
The REST API documentation is available at `+http://localhost:[port]/docs+`.
Alternatively, refer to the specifications in link:https://exportpdf.api.tiny.cloud/docs[https://exportpdf.api.tiny.cloud/docs^].

If the authorization for the API is enabled, provided an authorization token. More instructions can be found in the xref:individual-export-to-pdf-on-premises.adoc#authorization[authorization] section.

=== Using additional HTTP headers

If fetching some resources (e.g. images) used in a generated PDF requires passing an additional authorization factor in the form of additional HTTP headers:

. It can be defined on the application startup by setting `EXTRA_HTTP_HEADERS` environmental variable where the value is a stringified JSON object with required headers.
. It can be defined in a request sent to the PDF Converter API in `options`:

[source, js, subs="attributes+"]
----
const data = {
  html: '<p>I am a teapot</p><img src="https://secured-example-website.com/image.jpg">',
  css: 'p { color: red; }',
  options: {
    extra_http_headers: {
      authorization: 'Bearer <replace_with_your_auth_key>'
    }
  }
};

axios.post( '{exportpdf_service_url}', data, config )
  .then( response => {
    fs.writeFileSync('./file.pdf', response.data, 'binary')
  }).catch( error => {
    console.log( error );
  });
----

[TIP]
Headers defined in the application config and from the request are merged. If the same header is defined in both places, a header value from PDF options is prioritized over the value from the application config.

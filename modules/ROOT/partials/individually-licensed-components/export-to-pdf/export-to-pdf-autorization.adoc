== Authorization

To enable authorization, set the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable during the xref:individual-export-to-pdf-on-premises.adoc#installation[installation].

If the `SECRET_KEY` variable is set, then all requests must have a header with a JWT (JSON Web Token) signed with this key. The token should be passed as a value of the `Authorization` header for each request sent to the {pluginname} REST API.

[NOTE]
If the `SECRET_KEY` is not setup during the installation, then {pluginname} On-Premises will not require any headers with tokens when sending requests to the {pluginname} REST API. However, this it is not recommend to skip the authorization when running {pluginname} On-Premises in a public network.

=== Generating the token

{companyname} recommends using the libraries listed on link:http://jwt.io/[jwt.io] to generate the token. The token is considered valid, when:

* it is signed with the same `SECRET_KEY` as passed to the {pluginname} On-Premises instance,
* it was created within the last 24 hours,
* it is not issued in the future (e.i. the iat timestamp cannot be newer than the current time),
* it has not expired yet.


If the specific use case involves sending requests from a backend server, then JWT tokens can be generated locally, as shown in the below request example.

In the case of editor plugins or other frontend usages, a token endpoint should be created, that returns a valid JWT token for authorized users.

.Example of a endpoint implementation.
[source, js]
----
const express = require( 'express' );
const jwt = require( 'jsonwebtoken' );

const SECRET_KEY = 'secret_key';

const app = express();

app.use( ( req, res, next ) => {
  res.setHeader( 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*' );
  res.setHeader( 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET' );

  next();
});

app.get( '/', ( req, res ) => {
  const result = jwt.sign( {}, SECRET_KEY, { algorithm: 'HS256' } );

  res.send( result );
});

app.listen( 8080, () => console.log( 'Listening on port 8080' ) );
----

=== Using editor plugins

Plugins for {productname} will automatically request the token from the given `tokenUrl` variable and set the `Authorization` header when making an export request.

[NOTE]
Refer to the xref:exportpdf.adoc[{pluginname}] plugin documentation for details on adding the {pluginname} feature to the editor.

=== Request example with an Authorization header

The following example presents a request that generates valid JWT token and sets it as `Authorization` header:

[source, js]
----
const fs = require( 'fs' );
const jwt = require( 'jsonwebtoken' );
const axios = require( 'axios' );

const SECRET_KEY = 'secret';

const token = jwt.sign( {}, SECRET_KEY, { algorithm: 'HS256' } );

const data = {
  html: "<p>I am a teapot</p>",
  css: "p { color: red; }",
};

const config = {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': token
  },
  responseType: 'arraybuffer',
};

axios.post( 'http://localhost:8080/v1/convert', data, config )
  .then( response => {
    fs.writeFileSync('./file.pdf', response.data, 'binary');
  }).catch( error => {
    console.log( error );
   });
----

`SECRET_KEY` it’s the key which has been passed to the {pluginname} On-Premises instance

Please refer to the link:https://exportpdf.api.tiny.cloud/docs[{pluginname} REST API documentation] to start using the service.

[NOTE]
If API clients like Postman or Insomnia are used, then set the JWT token as an `Authorization` header in the `Headers` tab. Do not use the built-in token authorization as this will generate invalid header with a `Bearer` prefix added to the token.

== Overview

{pluginname} is a set of two converter services that allow for both exporting a structured HTML content (e.g. created with {productname} WYSIWYG editor) into a `.docx` Microsoft Word file and for importing content from `.docx` and `.dotx` files and converting it into a styled HTML document.

A valid license key is needed in order to install {pluginname} On-Premises. link:https://www.tiny.cloud/contact/[Contact us] for a trial license key.

The documentation in this section refers to a simplified version of the {pluginname} On-Premises which was designed to be easy to set up and maintain (while preserving all the features). It also lowers the running costs by reducing the number of servers required to run the whole application to the minimum.

The only requirement to run {pluginname} On-Premises is a container runtime or orchestration tool e.g. Docker, Kubernetes, Podman.

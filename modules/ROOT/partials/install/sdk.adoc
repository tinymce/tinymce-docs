=== Step 1: Download the Self-hosted package

If you'd rather download and install the script manually, get the package from link:{gettiny}[{productname} Downloads].

Unzip the package and move the `'path/to/{prodnamecode}/'` directory into a web accessible location on your web server (for example, `localhost`).

=== Step 2: Include the TinyMCE script

Include this line of code in the `<head>` of your HTML page:

[,html]
----
<script src="path/to/tinymce/js/tinymce.min.js"></script>
----

=== Step 3: Initialize TinyMCE as part of a web form

With the script included, initialize {productname} on any element (or elements) in your web page.

Since {productname} lets you identify replaceable elements via a CSS selector, all you need do is pass an object that contains a `selector` to `tinymce.init()`.

In this example, let's replace `<textarea id='mytextarea'>` with a {productname} editor instance by passing the selector `'#mytextarea'` to `tinymce.init()`.

[,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <script src="/path/to/tinymce/tinymce.min.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript">
  tinymce.init({
    selector: '#mytextarea'
  });
  </script>
</head>

<body>
<h1>{productname} Quick Start Guide</h1>
  <form method="post">
    <textarea id="mytextarea">Hello, World!</textarea>
  </form>
</body>
</html>
----

=== Step 4: Saving content with a form POST

When the `<form>` is submitted the {productname} editor mimics the behavior of a normal HTML `<textarea>` during the `post`. In your form handler you can process the content submitted as if it had come from a regular `<textarea>`.

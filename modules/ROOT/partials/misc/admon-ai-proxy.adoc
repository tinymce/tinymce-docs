IMPORTANT: For the sake of demonstration, the following examples show how to use the authentication credentials  with the API within the client side integration. This is not recommended for production purposes. We recommend only accessing the API with a xref:ai-proxy.adoc[proxy server] or implementing a server-side integration. This will prevent unauthorized access to the API.

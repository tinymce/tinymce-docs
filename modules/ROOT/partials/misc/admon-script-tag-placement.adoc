[IMPORTANT]
The plugin script tag must be positioned between the {productname} script tag and the `tinymce.init()` call. For applications that bundle {productname}, delay the `tinymce.init()` call until the plugin script tag has fully loaded. This ensures that the plugin is available when the editor is initialized.

NOTE: The user’s preference takes precedence over the configuration at the next initialization. The user’s preference is saved to `localStorage` when the user enables or disables the autocorrection via the menu item.

NOTE: When used with the xref:introduction-to-tiny-spellchecker.adoc[Spell Checker Pro] plugin, autocorrection is disabled when a non-English language is selected. A user can, however, re-enable autocorrection by selecting the *Tools > Autocorrect* menu item.

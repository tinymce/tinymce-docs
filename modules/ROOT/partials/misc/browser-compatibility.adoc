=== Notes on the supported web browsers table.

. _Penultimate version_ is defined as the most-recent-but-one _major_ version of the listed browser.
.. And _major version_ is defined as a change to the whole number portion of a browser’s version number.
... For example Google Chrome 110 is the major version release that supercedes Google Chrome 109. So long as Google Chrome 110 is the current version, Google Chrome 109 will be the penultimate version.
. The 60 days of support for penultimate versions begins as of the release of the current version. Once a current browser release is more than 60 days old, {productname} is no longer supported on the penultimate version.
. {productname} is supported on the most recent update of the browsers listed above, on the operating systems listed above.
. {productname} is not supported on browsers running in Quirks or backward compatibility modes.
. {productname} is not supported on pre-release, beta, or other ‘technology preview’ browser releases.
. On browsers that offer a longer-term stable version (ie Firefox Extended Support Release and Chrome Extended stable), {productname} is only supported on the current longer-term stable release.

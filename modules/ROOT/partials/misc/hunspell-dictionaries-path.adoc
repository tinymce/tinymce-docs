The `ephox.spelling.hunspell-dictionaries-path` setting is used to define the location of the Hunspell dictionaries. When the setting is not provided, Hunspell dictionaries are not supported.

Requirements:

* The directory containing the Hunspell dictionaries must conform to the file structure defined in xref:self-hosting-hunspell.adoc#hunspelldictionarystorageforspellcheckerpro[Hunspell dictionary storage for Spell Checker Pro].
* The directory containing the Hunspell dictionaries must be on the same server machine (or docker container) as the java service.

{companyname} recommends storing the Hunspell dictionaries in a similar location to the `application.conf` file. For example, if `application.conf` is in a directory called `/opt/ephox`, the Hunspell dictionaries should be stored in the subdirectory `/opt/ephox/hunspell-dictionaries`.

Example:

[source, conf]
----
ephox {
  spelling {
    hunspell-dictionaries-path: "/opt/ephox/hunspell-dictionaries"
  }
}
----

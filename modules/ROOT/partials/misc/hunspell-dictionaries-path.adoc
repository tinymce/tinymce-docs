The `+ephox.spelling.hunspell-dictionaries-path+` setting is used to define the location of the Hunspell dictionaries. When the setting is not provided, Hunspell dictionaries are not supported.

Requirements:

* The directory containing the Hunspell dictionaries must conform to the file structure defined in xref:self-hosting-hunspell.adoc#hunspell-dictionary-storage-for-spell-checker[Hunspell dictionary storage for Spell Checker].
* The directory containing the Hunspell dictionaries must be on the same server machine (or docker container) as the java service.

{companyname} recommends storing the Hunspell dictionaries in a similar location to the `+application.conf+` file. For example, if `+application.conf+` is in a directory called `+/opt/ephox+`, the Hunspell dictionaries should be stored in the subdirectory `+/opt/ephox/hunspell-dictionaries+`.

Example:

[source,properties]
----
ephox {
  spelling {
    hunspell-dictionaries-path: "/opt/ephox/hunspell-dictionaries"
  }
}
----

== Inline formatting.

List bullets and list numbers can be spot- or inline-formatted.

If an end-user selects the contents of a list item and applies inline formatting, such as a change of color or change of font-size, this spot formatting is also applied to the list item’s associated bullet or number.

Only the bullets or list numbers associated with the selection are inline-formatted.

NOTE: PowerPaste does not, currently, support inline-formatted bullets or list numbers. Inline-formatting, as applied to the bullets or list numbers, is lost when such material is copied and pasted.

If the selection is one list item (that is, if the selection runs from an particular `<li>` tag to its associated `</li>` tag), only the bullet or number associated with the single selected list item takes on the inline-formatting.

If the selection is the entire list, (ie, if the selection runs from the list’s opening `<ol>` or `<ul>` tag to the closing `</ol>` or `</ul>` tag, or if the selection runs from the list’s first `<li>` tag to the last `</li>` tag), every bullet or number takes on the inline-formatting.

IMPORTANT: If, after applying inline-formatting, a partial selection of the now inline-formatted material is made and said inline-formatting is removed from the partial selection, the bullet or list-number formatting will also be removed.

== Inline formatting

include::partial$misc/admon-requires-6.2v.adoc[]

List bullets and list numbers can now be inline-formatted.

Inline-formatting, also known as spot-formatting, is the direct formatting of an object. It contrasts with formatting applied to an object because that object is a particular type of object.

If an end-user selects the entire contents of a list item and applies inline formatting — such as a color change or a font-size change — this spot-formatting is also applied to the list item’s associated bullet or number.

Only the list bullets or list numbers associated with the selection take on the inline-formatting applied to the selection.

If the selection having inline formatting applied is one list item (that is, if the selection runs from one `<li>` tag to its associated `</li>` tag), the bullet or number associated with the selected list item takes on the inline-formatting applied to the selection.

If the selection is the entire list, (that is, if the selection runs from the list’s opening `<ol>` or `<ul>` tag to the closing `</ol>` or `</ul>` tag, or if the selection runs from the list’s first `<li>` tag to the last `</li>` tag), every bullet or number takes on the inline-formatting applied to the selection.

IMPORTANT: If, after applying inline-formatting, a partial selection of the now inline-formatted material is made and said inline-formatting is removed from the partial selection, the list bullet or list number formatting will also be removed.


=== PowerPaste Premium plugin support

Users of the xref:introduction-to-powerpaste.adoc[PowerPaste] Premium plugi] should note, this plugin does not, currently, support inline-formatted bullets or list numbers.

Inline-formatting, as applied to the bullets or list numbers, is lost when such material is copied and pasted using the PowerPaste plugin.

NOTE: Inline-formatting as applied to list elements has always been supported by xref:introduction-to-powerpaste.adoc[PowerPaste] and continues to be so supported.

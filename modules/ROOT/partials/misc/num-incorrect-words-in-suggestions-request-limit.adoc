Adding the `num-incorrect-words-in-suggestions-request-limit` element and setting it to a number instructs the spelling service to reject any requests for `/2/` suggestions where the number of **incorrect** words exceeds the specified limit. The default is to have no limit.

Example:

[source,properties]
----
ephox {
  spelling {
    num-incorrect-words-in-suggestions-request-limit = 100
  }
}
----

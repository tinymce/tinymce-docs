== Using `+onSetup+`

`+onSetup+` is a complex property. It takes a function that is passed the component's API and should return a callback that is passed the component's API and returns nothing. This occurs because `+onSetup+` runs whenever the component is rendered, and the returned callback is executed when the component is destroyed. This is essentially an `+onTeardown+` handler, and can be used to unbind events and callbacks.

To clarify, in code `+onSetup+` may look like this:

[source,js]
----
onSetup: (api) => {
  // Do something here on component render, like set component properties or bind an event listener

  return (api) => {
    // Do something here on teardown, like unbind an event listener
  };
};
----

To bind a callback function to an editor event use `+editor.on(eventName, callback)+`. To unbind an event listener use `+editor.off(eventName, callback)+`. Any event listeners _should_ be unbound in the teardown callback. The only editor event which does not need to be unbound is `+init+` e.g. `+editor.on('init', callback)+`.

[NOTE]
====
* The callback function for `+editor.off()+` should be the same function passed to `+editor.on()+`. For example, if a `+editorEventCallback+` function is bound to the `+NodeChange+` event when the button is created, `+onSetup+` should return `+(api) => editor.off('NodeChange', editorEventCallback)+`.
* If `+onSetup+` does not have any event listeners or only listens to the `+init+` event, `+onSetup+` can return an empty function e.g. `+return () => {};+`.

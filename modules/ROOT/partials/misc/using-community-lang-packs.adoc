=== Using the community language packs

ifeval::[{forModuleLoaders} != true]
NOTE: {companyname} recommends using the `language_url` for the community language packs, to avoid copying the language pack into the `tinymce/langs` folder every time you upgrade {productname}.
endif::[]

To use change the user interface language using a community language pack:

. Download the language pack from link:{gettiny}/language-packages/[the {companyname} Community Language Packages download page].
ifeval::[{forModuleLoaders} == true]
. Unzip and import/require the language file.
endif::[]
ifeval::[{forModuleLoaders} != true]
. Unpack the language file into the `tinymce/langs` folder.
endif::[]
. Set the xref:configure-localization.adoc#language[`language`] option in your {productname} configuration to the language code, matching the filename on the language pack. For example: If the language pack has the filename `sv_SE.js`, then set `language: 'sv_SE'`,
. Confirm that the language has been set successfully by loading {productname}.

NOTE: The language code set in the {productname} configuration must match the filename of the language file. If the language file is not found, {productname} will not load.

If a language you need is not available, you may wish to translate it yourself. To contribute to translating {productname}, go to our https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/tinymce/[Transifex translation] page and sign up, then request to join a team or create a new team if your language are not listed.

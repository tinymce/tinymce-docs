The following procedure will assist with bundling \{\{installtype}} version of \{\{site.productname}} with \{\{bundler}} using \{\{syntax}}. The procedure assumes the user has experience with \{\{bundler}} and \{\{syntax}}. The following steps provide a working example for bundling a basic \{\{site.productname}} configuration with \{\{bundler}}, and provides links to reference pages at the end of the procedure for bundling additional customizations with the editor.

If \{\{site.productname}} will be used with a JavaScript framework (such as React.js, Angular, or Vue.js) the bundle will also require the relevant framework integration package (where available). For a list of supported framework integrations, see: link:{baseurl}/getting-started/install-setup/self-hosted/[Integrate with other projects].

The following procedure will assist with bundling {installtype} version of {productname} with {bundler} using {syntax}. The procedure assumes the user has experience with {bundler} and {syntax}. The following steps provide a working example for bundling a basic {productname} configuration with {bundler}, and provides links to reference pages at the end of the procedure for bundling additional customizations with the editor.

If {productname} will be used with a JavaScript framework (such as React.js, Angular, or Vue.js) the bundle will also require the relevant framework integration package (where available). For a list of supported framework integrations, see: xref:integrations.adoc[Integrate with other projects].

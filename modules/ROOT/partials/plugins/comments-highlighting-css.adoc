== Configuring the commented text and block CSS properties

The highlight styles are now a part of the overall content skin and are changed through customizing the skin.

{productname} open source project https://github.com/tinymce/oxide/blob/master/src/less/theme/content/comments/comments.less[oxide] (default skin), defines the variables used for changing the annotation colors.

Refer to the xref:creating-a-skin.adoc[documentation] for building a skin using this repo.

For more information on configuring {productname} formats, refer to the xref:content-formatting.adoc#formats[formats] section.

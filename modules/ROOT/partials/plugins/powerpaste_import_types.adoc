*Possible values:* `+'clean'+`, `+merge+`, `+prompt+` **or** a `+Function+`

What the supported string-based values do:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Value |Behavior

|`+clean+`
|Preserves the structure of the content such as headings, tables, and lists.

Removes inline styles and classes.

This results in simple content that uses the siteâ€™s CSS stylesheet while retaining the semantic structure of the original document.

|`+merge+`
|Preserves the inline formatting and structure of the original document.

Removes invalid and proprietary styles, tags and attributes.

This ensures the HTML is valid while more closely matching the original document formatting.

|`+prompt+`
|Prompts the user to choose between the `+clean+` and `+merge+` options after attempting to paste HTML content.
|===

Alternatively, this option can take an asynchronous function that returns a https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise[Promise] which will resolve with the string `+clean+` or `+merge+`. This allows the paste mode to be dynamically set each time a user pastes relevant content. It can be used, for example, to replicate the `+prompt+` dialog with a custom dialog.

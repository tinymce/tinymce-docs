==== Changes to `clean` paste and `Remove Formatting` paste

*PowerPaste* _5.0_ included a change to the `Remove Formatting` functionality to filter out inline style elements (such as `strong`, `b`, `em`, `i`, and `sub`), in-line with other editor functionality.

*PowerPaste* _5.2_ *reverses the _5.0_ change* and includes a new `powerpaste_clean_filtered_inline_elements` setting. This setting accepts a list of inline style elements to be filtered. These inline elements will be filtered on `clean` or `Remove Formatting` paste.

To retain the _5.0_ default inline style element filter, add the following setting to `tinymce.init`:
[source, js]
----
powerpaste_clean_filtered_inline_elements: 'strong,em,b,i,u,strike,sup,sub,font'
----

For information on `powerpaste_clean_filtered_inline_elements`, see: xref:plugins/premium/powerpaste.adoc#powerpaste_clean_filtered_inline_elements[PowerPaste - `powerpaste_clean_filtered_inline_elements`].

==== Pre-filtering and post-filtering callbacks

*PowerPaste* 5.2 modifies the _pre-filtering_ and _post-filtering_ callbacks. The callbacks now contain additional data regarding the paste `mode` and the `source` of the content.

For information on using the Pre-filtering and Post-filtering callbacks, see: xref:plugins/premium/powerpaste.adoc#pre-filtering-and-post-filtering-callbacks[PowerPaste Plugin - Pre-filtering and post-filtering callbacks]

[[new-and-improved-apis]]
== New and improved APIs

[[editor-annotator-removeall]]
=== `editor.annotator.removeAll`

The new `editor.annotator.removeAll` API replaces the `removeAll` method built-in to the Comments plugin.

[[editor-options]]
=== `editor.options` and `tinymce.activeEditor.options`

The new `editor.options` API replaces two old APIs: `editor.settings` and `editor.getParam`.

Along with this new API, the new `tinymce.activeEditor.options` API replaces `tinymce.activeEditor.settings`.

[[editor-uploadImages]]
=== `editor.uploadImages()`

The results returned from `editor.uploadImages()` API now include a `removed` property.

The property will be `true` when an image being uploaded is removed after failing to upload.

[[fakeclipboard]]
=== `FakeClipboard`

The new `FakeClipboard` API provides a means for storing state that can be set and accessed by plugins and the core editor.

`FakeClipboard` is implemented on the {productname} global, allowing anything to write to it and read from it.

[[resource-unload]]
=== `Resource.unload`

The new `Resource.unload` API makes it possible to unload resources in the resource loader.

[[setdata-api]]
=== `setData` method in the Dialog API

The dialog API’s `setData` method now uses a deep merge algorithm.

Consequently, it now supports partial nested objects.

[[promise]]
=== `success` and `failure` callbacks replaced by `Promise` in multiple APIs

Previously, the `AddOnManager`, `PluginManager`, `ScriptLoader`, `StyleSheetLoader`, and `ThemeManager` APIs reported resource loading status with `success` or `failure` callbacks.

These APIs now, instead, return a `Promise`. Also, `EditorUpload`, which already returns a `Promise`, had callbacks removed.

[[changed-apis]]
== Changed APIs

[[closebutton]]
=== `closeButton` and `timeout`

Previously, using `closeButton` to disable a _Notification’s_ close button required a `timeout` value to also be set.

In {productname} 6, `closeButton` shows or hides the close button regardless of a `timeout` value being set or not set.

Equivalently, setting a `timeout` value sets how long the notification presents before automatically closing, regardless of whether a close button is displayed or not.

[[disabled]]
=== `disabled` methods renamed in all {productname} APIs

Previously, multiple {productname} APIs and UI components used `disable` or `disabled` in their method or property names.

In {productname} 6, these method and property names have been changed and configuration changes are required.

. `isDisabled()` methods are now `isEnabled()` methods.
. The `enable()` and `disable()` methods are now the single `setEnabled(<state>)` method.
. The `disable(<name>)` and `enable(<name>)` methods are now the single `setEnabled(<name>, <state>)` method in the Dialog APIs.
. The `disabled` property is now the `enabled` property in all {productname} UI components.

[[dom-domutils]]
=== `dom.DOMUtils`

The `toHex` method has been removed from `dom.DOMUtils`.

[[domparser]]
=== `DomParser`

The `filterNode` method has been removed from the `DomParser` API.

As well, the `DomParser` API no longer uses a custom parser internally and instead uses the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMParser[native `DOMParser` API].

[[editor-setcontent]]
=== `SetContent` editor event

The `content` property of the `SetContent` editor event has been deprecated.

[[env]]
=== `Env`

The following methods have been removed from the `Env` API:

* `opera`
* `webKit`
* `ie`
* `gecko`
* `mac`
* `iOS`
* `android`
* `desktop`
* `contentEditable`
* `caretAfter`
* `range`
* `ceFalse`
* `experimentalShadowDom`
* `fileApi`

Note, in particular, the removal of all legacy browser detection methods.

[[fire]]
=== `fire` methods renamed in all {productname} APIs

The `fire()` method in `tinymce.Editor`, `tinymce.dom.EventUtils`, `tinymce.dom.DOMUtils`, `tinymce.util.Observable` and `tinymce.util.EventDispatcher` has been renamed to `dispatch()`.

`fire` has been aliased to `dispatch`, so existing integrations should still work as expected.

`fire` has also, however, been marked as _deprecated_. Using `dispatch()` in place of `fire()` is recommended.

[[fixed-apis]]
== Fixed APIs

[[editor-annotator-remove]]
=== `editor.annotator.remove`

Previously, `editor.annotator.remove` scrolled to the removed contents position when removing an annotation.

It did not, as expected, retain the current selection or insertion position in the {productname} editor.

With this release, `editor.annotator.remove` does not change the selection or insertion position after removing an annotation.

[[editor-fire]]
=== `editor.fire()`

Previously, if the {productname} editor was removed, the `editor.fire()` API returned an incorrect object.

In {productname} 6.0, `editor.fire()`, which has been renamed `dispatch()`, returns the correct object even when the editor is removed.



[[editor-getcontent]]
=== `editor.getContent()`

The `editor.getContent()` API can now provide custom content by preventing and overriding `content` in the `BeforeGetContent` event.

This makes it consistent with the `editor.selection.getContent()` API.

The `editor.setContent()` API can also now be prevented from using the `BeforeSetContent` event.

This, too, makes it consistent with the `editor.selection.setContent()` API.

[[editor-selection-getcontent]]
=== `editor.selection.getContent()`

When the `no_events` argument is set to `true`, events should not fire when `getContent` is called. Previously, `editor.selection.getContent()` did not respect this.

In {productname} 6.0, `editor.selection.getContent()` treats the `no_events` setting as expected: when set to `false`, events are fired; when set to `true`, events are not fired.

[[removed-or-deprecated-apis]]
== Removed or deprecated APIs

[[html-styles]]
=== `html.Styles`

The `toHex` method has been removed from `html.Styles`.


[[removed-or-deprecated-apis-saxparser]]
=== `SaxParser`

With all parsing moved to the `DomParser` API, the `SaxParser` API has been removed.


[[removed-or-deprecated-apis-tables]]
=== Table

The `table` plugin’s functionality is, as of {productname} 6.0, entirely focussed on the user interface (UI) for creating and editing tables.

The code that generates tables is now a Core part of {productname} 6.0.

Since the `table` plugin API was entirely concerned with generating tables, it has been removed.


[[removed-or-deprecated-apis-tinymce-util-promise]]
=== `tinymce.util.Promise`

The `tinymce.util.Promise` API has been removed.

[[fixed-properties]]
== Fixed properties

[[tinymce-settings]]
=== `tinymce.settings`

When a {productname} editor instance was ended, the global setting, `tinymce.settings`, which is set at editor initialisation, retained references to DOM elements from the no-longer extant editor instance.

With this release, `tinymce.settings` is no longer set at editor initialisation and is not otherwise used by {productname}.

[[removed-or-deprecated-properties]]
== Removed or deprecated properties

[[editor-settings]]
=== `editor.settings`

The `editor.settings` property has been replaced by the `Options` API.

It has, consequently, been removed from {productname} 6.0.

[[fixed]]
=== `fixed`

The `fixed` property has been removed from the `tinymce.html.Node` class.

[[short-ended]]
=== `shortEnded`

The `shortEnded` property has been removed from the `tinymce.html.Node` class.

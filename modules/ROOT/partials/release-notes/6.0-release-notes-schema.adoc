== New and improved schema

{productname} 6.0 instances now use HTML 5 as the default schema.

The previous default was, for practical purposes, also HTML 5 but no specific schema was set. This change formalises and makes explicit what was, previously, only implicit.

NOTE: `html5-strict` is still an available schema option and is unchanged from {productname} 5.x.

[[assignment-operator-character]]
=== Assignment operator character
The assignment operator character — `:` — has been changed to `~` for the `valid_elements` and `extended_valid_elements` schemata.

The `:` is also used to assign an [xlink:href] rule and this was not possible in these schemata because the colon character was acting as an assignment operator.

This change allows both schemata to set attribute values for the `valid_elements` and `extended_valid_elements` options using the `~` character and assign [xlink:href] rules as expected.

In TinyMCE 5.0, some configurations have been removed because they are no longer necessary or an improved solution has been introduced. Refer to the xref:migration-from-4x.adoc[Migration Guide], for more information.

=== Editor-Core removed settings

|===
| *Setting* | *Description*

| https://www.tiny.cloud/docs-4x/configure/editor-appearance/#fixed_toolbar_container[`fixed_toolbar_container`]
| Owing to the enhancements to the new inline toolbar behaviour, `fixed_toolbar_container` is not required in TinyMCE 5.0.

| https://www.tiny.cloud/docs-4x/configure/editor-appearance/#insert_button_items[`insert_button_items`]
| Owing to the changes in the menus and removal of the `context` property, `insert_button_items` is not required in TinyMCE 5.0. Refer to the xref:migration-from-4x.adoc#removededitorsettings[Migration guide] for a workaround.

=== Removed toolbar button types

https://www.tiny.cloud/docs-4x/demo/custom-toolbar-listbox/[Listbox] is no longer a supported toolbar button type in TinyMCE 5.0. Though listbox has been removed, any functionality provided by custom listbox toolbar buttons can be retained by switching to a different kind of toolbar button using the new methods. The recommended toolbar button type to switch to is the *Split* button.

=== Removed features

The following plugins from TinyMCE 4.x do not require height or width options to be specified in TinyMCE 5.0:

* xref:codesample.adoc[Codesample]
* xref:preview.adoc[Preview]

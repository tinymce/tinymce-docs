|Field |Type |Description
|`+userId+` |`+string+` |This is the user's unique ID (the `+sub+` field from their xref:rtc-jwt-authentication.adoc[JWT], which is also used for xref:rtc-options-optional.adoc#_rtc_user_details_provider[`+rtc_user_details_provider+`]). Multiple connection events will be received with the same user ID if a user opens multiple sessions (for example on desktop and mobile).
|`+userDetails+` |`+object+` |This is a copy of the object returned by xref:rtc-options-optional.adoc#_rtc_user_details_provider[`+rtc_user_details_provider+`]. RTC only uses the `+fullName+` field, but the entire object will be cloned and passed to `+rtc_client_connected+`.If a user details provider is not configured, this will be an empty object.
|`+clientId+` |`+string+` |This is a unique identifier, generated by the RTC protocol, that can be used to differentiate between the same user connecting multiple times.
|`+caretNumber+` |`+integer+` |This will be a number between 1 and 8, corresponding to one of https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/blob/master/modules/oxide/src/less/theme/content/rtc/rtc.less#L1-L8[the 8 colors defined in TinyMCE CSS]. TinyMCE supports 8 distinct caret colors. If more than 8 clients connect to a session, the numbers will be reused.A custom skin is required to change these colors, and no more than 8 are supported. For information on creating a custom skin, see: xref:customize-ui.adoc[Customizing the Editor UI].
|`+clientInfo+` |`+object+` |This is a copy of the xref:rtc-options-optional.adoc#_rtc_client_info[`+rtc_client_info+`] data from the remote user's editor configuration.If none was configured, this will be an empty object.

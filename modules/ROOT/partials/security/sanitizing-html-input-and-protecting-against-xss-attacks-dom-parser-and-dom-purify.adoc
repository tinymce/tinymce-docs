=== Sanitizing HTML input to protect against XSS attacks

Previously, before HTML content was passed to {productname} 5.x, it was parsed using an https://tiny.cloud/docs/api/tinymce.html/tinymce.html.saxparser/[in-house developed API], `SaxParser`.

The `SaxParser` API was developed in the then-absence of alternatives.

When this API’s validate setting was enabled — `validate: true` — `SaxParser` removed elements and attributes that did not fit the declared schema.

And, over its lifetime, `SaxParser` was extended. For example, as of {productname} 5.9, the `SaxParser` API marked attributes with certain names or IDs as unsafe, because some names or IDs can cause the host browser to overwrite existing properties or functions.

For {productname} 6.0, however, this basic parser was removed and replaced with two significantly more thorough alternatives:

. the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMParser[native browser API], `DOMParser()`; and
. the Free and Open Source _https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify[XSS sanitizer for HTML, MathML and SVG]_, `DOMPurify`.

NOTE: {productname} uses DomPurify [2.4.4 | 3.0.0]. <Sentence here explaining why we use the [old | new] version.

Before HTML (or XML) content is passed to {productname} 6.x, the `DOMParser` API parses the HTML (or XML) string into a https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model[DOM object]. As part of this process, `DOMParser` attempts to correct mal-formed HTML.

For example, the following string:

[source,html]
----
<p>
<a href="https://example.com">Click here.
</p>
----

When this string is passed in, the `DOMParser` API adds the missing closing anchor tag:

[source,html]
----
<p>
<a href="https://example.com">Click here.</a>
</p>
----

Next, the, now correctly formed, DOM object is passed to `DOMPurify`.

`DOMPurify` runs a security-focussed ruleset over the DOM object to sanitize the HTML and protect {productname}, and applications built using {productname}, against XSS attacks.

==== Turning `DOMPurify` off

Both `DOMParser` and `DOMPurify` are on by default, and `DOMParser` cannot be turned off.

As of {productname} 6.4, however, it is possible to turn `DOMPurify` off using the `xss_sanitization` option.

NOTE: `xss_sanitization` is set to `true` by default. That is, {productname} specifically sets the `xss_sanitization` option to `true`, even if this option is not declared in a {productname} configuration.

*Type:* `+Boolean+`

*Default value:* `+true+`

*Possible values:* `+true+`, `+false+`

===== Example: using `+xss_sanitization+` to turn DOMPurify off and no longer sanitize HTML against XSS attacks

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  xss_sanitization: false
});
----

WARNING: Turning `DomPurify` off leaves {productname}, and any application using {productname}, extremely vulnerable to XSS attacks. Only turn `DomPurify` off if alternative and equivalently capable HTML and XML sanitisation and XSS protections are in place.

:description: Normalizes list behavior between browsers.
:keywords: list lists browser normalize
:title_nav: Lists

The `lists` plugin allows you to add numbered and bulleted lists to TinyMCE. To enable advanced lists (e.g. alpha numbered lists, square bullets) you should also enable the link:../advlist/[Advanced List] (`advlist`) plugin.

The plugin also normalizes list behavior between browsers. Enable it if you have problems with consistency making lists.

===== Example

`js
tinymce.init({
  selector: "textarea",  // change this value according to your HTML
  plugins: "lists",
  toolbar: "numlist bullist"
});
`

== Options

These settings affect the execution of the `lists` plugin.

=== `lists_indent_on_tab`

This boolean option allows to disable the indent on tab key functionality. It's default value is set to `true`.

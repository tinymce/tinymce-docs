The Code Sample plugin (`codesample`) lets a user insert and embed syntax color highlighted code snippets into the editable area. It also adds a button to the toolbar which on click will open a dialog box to accept raw code input.

## Basic setup

```js
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  plugins: 'codesample',
  toolbar: 'codesample'
});
```

By default, `codesample` uses `http://prismjs.com/` to embed the code samples within the editor and works out of the box. That is, when a user copies valid code syntax into the editable area the code will be automatically formatted according to Prism default CSS rules.

> **Note**: Prism.js and prism.css need to be added to a page for syntax highlighting to work. See the instructions below to learn how to do this.

## Using Prism.js on your web page

You need to add `prism.js` and `prism.css` to your page in order to get the syntax highlighted code samples on your webpage (as created by the Code Sample plugin). The Code Sample plugin uses the following languages: markup, javascript, css, php, ruby, python, java, c, csharp and cpp. You can generate the `prism.js` and `prism.css` files on the [download](http://prismjs.com/download.html) page at the Prism website.

### Example of using the Prism.js script

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="prism.css">
<script src="prism.js"></script>
<pre class="language-markup"><code>...</code></pre>
```

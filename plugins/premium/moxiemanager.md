{{site.moxieMNotOnCloud}}

MoxieManager is a premium {{site.productname}} plugin and server system that enables users to insert files located externally to the editor (e.g. on their client desktop) into their document.

MoxieManager is an application separate from {{site.productname}} that includes .NET or PHP server components. Being built by the team behind {{site.productname}} it has tight integration with the editor via a toolbar control. It is designed to work with {{site.productname}} configuration settings such as `relative_urls`.

MoxieManager is a paid addition to {{site.productname}}. It is included in [{{enterpriseversion}} subscriptions]({{site.pricingpage}}).

Full documentation on MoxieManager, including how to [integrate with {{site.productname}}](http://www.moxiemanager.com/documentation/index.php/TinyMCE_Integration), can be [found](http://www.moxiemanager.com/documentation/) on the MoxieManager website.

Documentation is archived for the deprecated [MCImageManager](http://archive.tinymce.com/wiki.php/MCImageManager) and [MCFileManager](http://archive.tinymce.com/wiki.php/MCFileManager).

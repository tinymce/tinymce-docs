### Print plugin moved to TinyMCE Core

The Print plugin has been moved to Core in TinyMCE 6.0.

Its toolbar button, menu item, shortcut and command will now work by default, without needing to specify `print` as a plugin.

Integrators can remove `print` from the `plugins` section of their TinyMCE configuration.

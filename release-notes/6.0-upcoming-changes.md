## Themes

The `mobile` theme
: The dedicated `mobile` theme, sometimes referred to as the __legacy mobile theme__ was deprecated with the release of {{site.productname}} 5.1 and will be removed in {{site.productname}} 6.0. The `silver` theme was updated in {{site.productname}} 5.1 to provide an improved mobile experience.

## Plugins

Open source {{site.productname}} is re-gearing for future support of collaborative technologies and we want to shed some weight on plugins that could be improved greatly on our new collaborative platform.
  - In support of this, Tiny wishes to focus on solving the harder editing problems and provide them to the community through our APIs to enhance the power and flexibility {{site.productname}} provides.
  - We envisage developers will take these APIs to the next level by creating new innovative plugins
  - We have shifted our focus away from plugins that resolve a specific use case and provide better tools that are un-opinionated and could be used to tailor solutions that best fit the developers needs

The following plugins will be removed in {{site.productname}} 6.0 and will need to be removed from the `plugins` option when upgrading:

BBCode (`bbcode`)
: The BBCode plugin (`bbcode`) was deprecated with the release of {{site.productname}} 5.9. For details, see [the BBCode plugin deprecation notice]({{site.baseurl}}/release-notes/release-notes59/#thebbcodebbcodeplugin). The BBCode plugin will be removed in {{site.productname}} 6.0.

Full Page (`fullpage`)
: The Full Page plugin (`fullpage`) was deprecated with the release of {{site.productname}} 5.9. For details, see [the Full Page plugin deprecation notice]({{site.baseurl}}/release-notes/release-notes59/#thefullpagefullpageplugin). The Full Page plugin will be removed in {{site.productname}} 6.0.

Image Tools (`imagetools`)
: The Image Tools plugin (`imagetools`) was deprecated with the release of {{site.productname}} 5.10.{% if site.productminorversion > 5.9 %} For details, see [the Image Tools plugin deprecation notice]({{site.baseurl}}/release-notes/release-notes510/#imagetoolsimagetoolsplugin).{% endif %} The Image Tools plugin will be removed in {{site.productname}} 6.0.

Legacy Output (`legacyoutput`)
: The Legacy Output plugin (`legacyoutput`) was deprecated with the release of {{site.productname}} 5.9. For details, see [the Legacy Output plugin deprecation notice]({{site.baseurl}}/release-notes/release-notes59/#thelegacyoutputlegacyoutputplugin). The Legacy Output plugin will be removed in {{site.productname}} 6.0.

Spell Checker (`spellchecker`)

## Options

The following options will be changed in {{site.productname}} 6.0:

toolbar_mode
: The [`toolbar_mode`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/editor-appearance/#toolbar_mode) option no-longer accepts the `false` value in {{site.productname}} 6.0, which was retained for backwards compatibility with the `toolbar_drawer` option. Use `'wrap'` instead to keep the same functionality as `false`.

forced_root_block
: The [`forced_root_block`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/content-filtering/#forced_root_block) option no-longer accepts the `false` value or an empty string value in {{site.productname}} 6.0. Setting `forced_root_block` to `false` blocks most editor functionality from working and caused non-semantic HTML to be generated.

The following options have been deprecated in {{site.productname}} 5.10 or earlier and will be removed in {{site.productname}} 6.0.

autoresize_on_init
: The [`autoresize_on_init`]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/opensource/autoresize/#autoresize_on_init) option does not affect the autoresize behavior in {{site.productname}} 5, as the editor will always resize regardless of this option. This option would only forcibly resize at short intervals after the editor has initialized, which is no longer required and as such will be removed.

convert_fonts_to_spans
: The [`convert_fonts_to_spans`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/content-filtering/#convert_fonts_to_spans) option would convert `font` elements to `span` styles to assist with the migration to newer HTML standards. Font elements were included in HTML 3 or earlier standards and have since been deprecated or removed.

gecko_spellcheck
: The [`gecko_spellcheck`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/spelling/#gecko_spellcheck) option was deprecated and replaced by the [`browser_spellcheck`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/spelling/#browser_spellcheck) option in {{site.productname}} 4.3.

images_dataimg_filter
: The [`images_dataimg_filter`]({{site.baseurl}}configure/file-image-upload/#images_dataimg_filter) option was deprecated in {{site.productname}} 5.3. This option can be used for an unintended use-case and is not compatible with Real-Time Collaboration.

media_scripts
: The [`media_scripts`]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/opensource/media/#media_scripts) option is no longer useful in the modern web and did not work in most cases. As such it has been deprecated in {{site.productname}} 5.10.

paste_convert_word_fake_lists
: The Microsoft Word specific paste handling functionality will be removed from the `paste` plugin. As a result, the [`paste_convert_word_fake_lists`]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/opensource/paste/#paste_convert_word_fake_lists) option will be removed in {{site.productname}} 6.0.

paste_retain_style_properties
: The Microsoft Word specific paste handling functionality will be removed from the `paste` plugin. As a result, the [`paste_retain_style_properties`]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/opensource/paste/#paste_retain_style_properties) option will be removed in {{site.productname}} 6.0.

paste_word_valid_elements
: The Microsoft Word specific paste handling functionality will be removed from the `paste` plugin. As a result, the [`paste_word_valid_elements`]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/opensource/paste/#paste_word_valid_elements) option will be removed in {{site.productname}} 6.0.

spellchecker_select_languages
: The [`spellchecker_select_languages`]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/premium/tinymcespellchecker/#spellchecker_select_languages) option was deprecated and replaced by the [`content_langs`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/localization/#content_langs) option in {{site.productname}} 5.9. The new option provides better support for the BCP47 standard used for `lang` attributes and increased configuration capabilities.

spellchecker_whitelist
: The `spellchecker_whitelist` option was deprecated and replaced by the [`spellchecker_ignore_list`]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/premium/tinymcespellchecker/#spellchecker_ignore_list) option in {{site.productname}} 5.7. The new option provides additional functionality and avoids sensitive naming.

table_responsive_width
: The `table_responsive_width` option was deprecated and replaced by the [`table_sizing_mode`]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/opensource/table/#table_sizing_mode) option in {{site.productname}} 5.4. Use the `'relative'` or `'fixed'` sizing modes to keep the same functionality.

toolbar_drawer
: The `toolbar_drawer` option was deprecated and replaced by the [`toolbar_mode`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/editor-appearance/#toolbar_mode) option in {{site.productname}} 5.2. This change was made to reflect the range of settings available for this option.

The following undocumented or unsupported legacy options will be removed in {{site.productname}} 6.0.

block_elements
: The `block_elements` option could overide the built-in HTML schema to specify which elements should be treated as blocks. Using this option can break the editor and requires the default to be repeated with any desired changes. Additionally, browsers can't be changed to render any of the customizations, so this was only useful for adding custom elements.

boolean_attributes
: The `boolean_attributes` option could override the built-in HTML schema to specify which attributes should be treated as boolean attributes, whereby the value is irrelevant. Using this option can break the editor and requires the default to be repeated with any desired changes. Additionally, browsers can't be changed to render or parse any of the customizations, so this was only useful for adding custom attributes.

content_editable_state
: The `content_editable_state` option controlled the initial state of the `contenteditable` attribute on the editor body. This caused issues. Once set, there was no way to change the state back later using the editor APIs and left the editor in an half-broken state.

editor_deselector
: The `editor_deselector` option is a legacy initialization option from {{site.productname}} 3 that allowed developers to specify a class to control which textareas should not be initialized as an editor. It was deprecated and replaced by the [`selector`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/integration-and-setup/#selector) or [`target`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/integration-and-setup/#target) options in {{site.productname}} 4.

editor_selector
: The `editor_selector` option is a legacy initialization option from {{site.productname}} 3 that allowed developers to specify a class to control which textareas should be initialized as an editor. It was deprecated and replaced by the [`selector`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/integration-and-setup/#selector) or [`target`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/integration-and-setup/#target) options in {{site.productname}} 4.

elements
: The `elements` option is a legacy initialization option from {{site.productname}} 3 that allowed specifying a list of element ids for elements that should be initialized as an editor. It was deprecated and replaced by the [`selector`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/integration-and-setup/#selector) or [`target`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/integration-and-setup/#target) options in {{site.productname}} 4.

file_browser_callback_types
: The `file_browser_callback_types` option was deprecated and replaced by the [`file_picker_types`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/file-image-upload/#file_picker_types) option in {{site.productname}} 5.0.

filepicker_validator_handler
: The `filepicker_validator_handler` option was deprecated and replaced by the `file_picker_validator_handler` option in {{site.productname}} 5.0.15 due to inconsistent naming.

force_hex_style_colors
: The `force_hex_style_colors` option was deprecated in {{site.productname}} 5.0. This option was used to force color styles stored as hexadecimal values instead of RGB strings.

force_p_newlines
: The `force_p_newlines` option was deprecated and replaced by the [`forced_root_block`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/content-filtering/#forced_root_block) option in {{site.productname}} 3.5. This option had been kept as an undocumented fallback.

inline_styles
: The `inline_styles` option was primarily used for assisting with the migration to newer HTML standards. It enabled converting some deprecated HTML 3 or earlier elements to inline styles, such as `font` and `strike`.

mode
: The `mode` option is a legacy initialization option from {{site.productname}} 3 that allowed controlling which mode was used to initialize the editor (`exact` or `textareas`). It was deprecated and replaced by the [`selector`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/integration-and-setup/#selector) or [`target`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/integration-and-setup/#target) options in {{site.productname}} 4.

move_caret_before_on_enter_elements
: The `move_caret_before_on_enter_elements` option allowed developers to override the built-in HTML schema to specify which elements the selection should be moved "in front of" when pressing enter on the keyboard. Using this option can break the editor and requires the default to be repeated with any desired changes.

non_empty_elements
: The `non_empty_elements` option allowed developers to override the built-in HTML schema to specify which elements should always be treated as not being empty. Using this option can break the editor and requires the default to be repeated with any desired changes.

padd_empty_with_br
: The `padd_empty_with_br` option would replace non-breaking spaces (`&nbsp;`) with `<br>` elements. This option however was misspelled, provided no functional difference to a non-breaking space and is incompatible with Real-Time Collaboration.

self_closing_elements
: The `self_closing_elements` option allowed developers to override the built-in HTML schema to specify which elements should be closed if a new element is started without a similar closing tag. Using this option can break the editor and requires the default to be repeated with any desired changes. Additionally, browsers can't be changed to parse the customizations, so this option was not useful for customization.

short_ended_elements
: The `short_ended_elements` option allowed developers to override the built-in HTML schema to specify which elements should be treated as void elements. Using this option can break the editor and requires the default to be repeated with any desired changes. Additionally, browsers can't be changed to parse the customizations, so this was only useful for adding custom elements.

special
: The `special` option allowed developers to override the built-in HTML schema to specify which elements should be treated as special and content inside should be treated as text when parsing HTML. Using this option can break the editor and requires the default to be repeated with any desired changes. Additionally, browsers can't be changed to parse differently, so this setting was not useful.

tab_focus
: The `tab_focus` option was deprecated and replaced by the [`tabfocus_elements`]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/opensource/tabfocus/#tabfocus_elements) option in {{site.productname}} 3.2. This option had been kept as an undocumented fallback.

text_block_elements
: The `text_block_elements` option allowed developers to override the built-in HTML schema to specify which elements should be treated as block text elements (such as those used for formatting). Using this option can break the editor and requires the default to be repeated with any desired changes.

text_inline_elements
: The `text_inline_elements` option allowed developers to override the built-in HTML schema to specify which elements should be treated as inline text elements (such as those used for formatting). Using this option can break the editor and requires the default to be repeated with any desired changes.

types
: The `types` option is a legacy initialization option from {{site.productname}} 3 that allowed developers to specify which type of elements should be initialized as an editor. It was deprecated and replaced by the [`selector`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/integration-and-setup/#selector) or [`target`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/integration-and-setup/#target) options in {{site.productname}} 4.

whitespace_elements
: The `whitespace_elements` option allowed developers to override the built-in HTML schema to specify which elements should be treated as rendering content as verbatim content. Using this option can break the editor and requires the default to be repeated with any desired changes. Additionally, browsers can't be changed to parse differently, so this was only useful to add custom elements.

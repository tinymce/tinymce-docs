## Options

The following options will be changed in {{site.productname}} 6.0:

toolbar_mode
: The [`toolbar_mode`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/editor-appearance/#toolbar_mode) option no-longer accepts the `false` value in {{site.productname}} 6.0 for backwards compatibility with the `toolbar_drawer` option. Use `'wrap'` instead to keep the same functionality as `false`.

forced_root_block
: The [`forced_root_block`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/content-filtering/#forced_root_block) option no-longer accepts the `false` value or an empty string value in {{site.productname}} 6.0. This value prevented various editor functionality from working and caused non-semantic HTML to be generated.

The following options have been deprecated in {{site.productname}} 5.10 or earlier and will be removed in {{site.productname}} 6.0.

autoresize_on_init
: The [`autoresize_on_init`]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/opensource/autoresize/#autoresize_on_init) option doesn't do anything meaningful in TinyMCE 5, as the editor will always resize regardless of this option. This option would only forcibly resize at short intervals after the editor has initialized, which is no longer required and as such will be removed.

convert_fonts_to_spans
: The [`convert_fonts_to_spans`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/content-filtering/#convert_fonts_to_spans) option would convert font elements to span styles to assist with the migration to newer HTML standards. Font elements were used in HTML 3 or earlier and have since been deprecated or removed.

gecko_spellcheck
: The [`gecko_spellcheck`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/spelling/#gecko_spellcheck) option was deprecated and replaced by the [`browser_spellcheck`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/spelling/#browser_spellcheck) option in TinyMCE 4.3.

images_dataimg_filter
: Deprecated in 5.3, incompatible with RTC.

spellchecker_select_languages
: The [`spellchecker_select_languages`]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/premium/tinymcespellchecker/#spellchecker_select_languages) option was deprecated and replaced by the [`content_langs`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/localization/#content_langs) option in TinyMCE 5.9. The new option provides better support for the BCP47 standard used for `lang` attributes and increased configuration capabilities.

spellchecker_whitelist
: The `spellchecker_whitelist` option was deprecated and replaced by the [`spellchecker_ignore_list`]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/premium/tinymcespellchecker/#spellchecker_ignore_list) option in TinyMCE 5.7. The new option provides additional functionality and avoids cultural sensitive naming issues.

table_responsive_width
: The `table_responsive_width` option was deprecated and replaced by the [`table_sizing_mode`]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/plugins/opensource/table/#table_sizing_mode) option in TinyMCE 5.4. Use the `'relative'` or `'fixed'` sizing modes to keep the same functionality. 

toolbar_drawer
: The `toolbar_drawer` option was deprecated and replaced by the [`toolbar_mode`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/editor-appearance/#toolbar_mode) option in TinyMCE 5.2. This change was made to reflect the range of settings available for this option.

The following undocumented or unsupported legacy options will be removed in {{site.productname}} 6.0.

block_elements
: The `block_elements` option allowed overriding the built-in HTML schema to specify which elements should be treated as blocks. This setting is rather dangerous though, as it requires passing a full list at all times. Additionally, browsers can't be changed to render differently, so this was only useful to add custom elements.

boolean_attributes
: The `boolean_attributes` option allowed overriding the built-in HTML schema to specify which attributes should be treated as boolean attributes whereby the value is irrelevant. This setting is rather dangerous though, as it requires passing a full list at all times. Additionally, browsers can't be changed to render or parse differently, so this was only useful to add custom attributes.

content_editable_state
: The `content_editable_state` option controlled the initial state of the `contenteditable` attribute on the editor body. This however caused issues as there was no way to change the state back later using the editor APIs and left the editor in an half broken state.

editor_deselector
: The `editor_deselector` option is a legacy initialization option from TinyMCE 3 that allowed specifying a class to control which textareas should not be initialized as an editor. It was deprecated and replaced by the [`selector`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/integration-and-setup/#selector) or [`target`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/integration-and-setup/#target) options in TinyMCE 4.

editor_selector
: The `editor_deselector` option is a legacy initialization option from TinyMCE 3 that allowed specifying a class to control which textareas should be initialized as an editor. It was deprecated and replaced by the [`selector`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/integration-and-setup/#selector) or [`target`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/integration-and-setup/#target) options in TinyMCE 4.

elements
: The `elements` option is a legacy initialization option from TinyMCE 3 that allowed specifying a list of element ids for elements that should be initialized as an editor. It was deprecated and replaced by the [`selector`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/integration-and-setup/#selector) or [`target`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/integration-and-setup/#target) options in TinyMCE 4.

file_browser_callback_types
: The `file_browser_callback_types` option was deprecated and replaced by the [`file_picker_types`]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configure/file-image-upload/#file_picker_types) option in TinyMCE 5.0.

filepicker_validator_handler
: The `filepicker_validator_handler` option was deprecated and replaced by the `file_picker_validator_handler` option in TinyMCE 5.0.15 due to inconsistent naming.

force_hex_style_colors
: The `force_hex_style_colors` option was deprecated in TinyMCE 5.0. This option allowed forcing color styles to use hexadecimal instead of RGB strings.

force_p_newlines
: The `force_p_newlines` option was deprecated and replaced by the [`forced_root_block`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/content-filtering/#forced_root_block) option in TinyMCE 3.5. This option had been kept as an undocumented fallback.

inline_styles
: The `inline_styles` option was primarily used for assisting with the migration to newer HTML standards. It enabled converting some deprecated HTML 3 or earlier elements to inline styles, such as `font` and `strike`.

mode
: The `mode` option is a legacy initialization option from TinyMCE 3 that allowed controlling which mode was used to initialize the editor (`exact` or `textareas`). It was deprecated and replaced by the [`selector`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/integration-and-setup/#selector) or [`target`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/integration-and-setup/#target) options in TinyMCE 4.

move_caret_before_on_enter_elements
: Schema (can use API instead and is less risky)

non_empty_elements
: Schema (can use API instead and is less risky)

padd_empty_with_br
: The `padd_empty_with_br` option would replace non-breaking spaces (`&nbsp;`) with `<br>` elements. This option however was misspelled, provided no functional difference to a non-breaking space and is incompatible with Real-Time Collaboration.

self_closing_elements
: Schema (can use API instead and is less risky)

short_ended_elements
: Schema (can use API instead and is less risky)

special
: The `special` option allowed overriding the built-in HTML schema to specify which elements should be treated as special and content inside should be treated as text when parsing HTML. This setting is rather dangerous though, as it requires passing a full list at all times. Additionally, browsers can't be changed to parse differently, so this setting was not useful.

tab_focus
: The `tab_focus` option was deprecated and replaced by the [`tabfocus_elements`]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/opensource/tabfocus/#tabfocus_elements) option in TinyMCE 3.2. This option had been kept as an undocumented fallback.

text_block_elements
: The `text_block_elements` option allowed overriding the built-in HTML schema to specify which elements should be treated as block text elements (such as those used for formatting). This setting is rather dangerous though, as it requires passing a full list at all times.

text_inline_elements
: The `text_inline_elements` option allowed overriding the built-in HTML schema to specify which elements should be treated as inline text elements (such as those used for formatting). This setting is rather dangerous though, as it requires passing a full list at all times.

whitespace_elements
: The `whitespace_elements` option allowed overriding the built-in HTML schema to specify which elements should be treated as rendering content as verbatim content. This setting is rather dangerous though, as it requires passing a full list at all times. Additionally, browsers can't be changed to parse differently, so this was only useful to add custom elements.

types
: The `types` option is a legacy initialization option from TinyMCE 3 that allowed specifying which type of elements should be initialized as an editor. It was deprecated and replaced by the [`selector`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/integration-and-setup/#selector) or [`target`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/integration-and-setup/#target) options in TinyMCE 4.

### Toolbar Drawers

TinyMCE 5.0.2 introduces the ability to display overflowing toolbar buttons in an extra toolbar called a "toolbar drawer". The toolbar drawer is initially hidden, and can be shown by pressing the `toolbar_drawer` icon ![Drawer]({{site.baseurl}}/images/icons/more-drawer.svg). The button only appears if the toolbar buttons do not fit horizontally. This feature is configured using the `toolbar_drawer` configuration setting.
Refer to the [toolbar_drawer]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/editor-appearance/#toolbar_drawer) documentation for more information.

For more information on **Checklist** refer to the full [documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/premium/checklist/).

There is also a demo provided to explore the **Checklist** capabilities [here]({{site.baseurl}}/demo/checklist/).

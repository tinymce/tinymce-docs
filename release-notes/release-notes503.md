### Case Change

TinyMCE 5.0.3 introduces the **Case Change** plugin that allows changing the case of text in block selection to uppercase, lowercase, or title case.

Currently, there are three types of formats available:

![Case Change]({{site.baseurl}}/images/icons/change-case.svg)

* **lowercase** - The **lowercase** option changes all the selected characters to lowercase.

* **UPPERCASE** - The **UPPERCASE** option changes all the selected characters to uppercase.

* **Title Case** - The **Title Case** option changes anything other than articles, coordinating conjunctions, or short prepositions to capital letters. The default rule set for **Title Case** is based on [Wikipedia Title Case](https://titlecaseconverter.com/rules/#WP).

To try out **Case Change** start with this [dedicated product page]({{site.productpages}}/case-change/) to see all the flexible pricing options.

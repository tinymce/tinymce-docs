### URL dialog UI component

The URL dialog user interface component has been introduced in TinyMCE 5.0.4. A URL dialog is a special TinyMCE UI component which loads an external web page inside a dialog (sometimes referred to as modals). This differs from the regular dialogs that use supported components to render an interactive dialog inside the application. URL dialogs are useful for very complex use cases, where the supported dialog components cannot be used â€” for example, a custom file manager that is loaded inside a TinyMCE dialog.

For more information on the **URL dialog**, refer to the [documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/ui-components/urldialog/).

### Custom sidebar toggle button

In TinyMCE 5.0.4, when a new sidebar is registered, a corresponding toolbar button for toggling the sidebar open and close is also created using the same name. This button can then be included in the `toolbar` settings by adding the sidebar name to the toolbar options.

For more information on custom sidebar, refer to the [documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/ui-components/customsidebar/)

## New features

### TinyMCE

#### Help API

The **Help** plugin includes a new `help_tabs` setting and an API to be able to add tabs from within custom plugins. This allows for the default tabs to be enabled/disabled, change the tab order or to add additional tabs to the help dialog.

For more information on the new `help_tabs` setting and API refer to the [documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/opensource/help/).

#### Image Tools custom image fetch

The **Image Tools** plugin includes a new `imagetools_fetch_image` setting, which allows a custom function to be used to fetch the image content in complex environments, where extra customization is required, such as authentication.

For more information on `imagetools_fetch_image` refer to the [documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/opensource/imagetools/#imagetools_fetch_image).

#### Insert table dialog

A new dedicated toolbar button `tableinsertdialog` and menu item `inserttabledialog` have been added to the **Table** plugin. This adds the ability to show both the insert table grid and dialog options at the same time.

For more information on new toolbar button and menu item refer to the [documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/opensource/table/#table_grid).

### Premium Skins and Icon Packs

The new **Premium Skins and Icon Packs** adds an easy way to quickly give TinyMCE a new look, or to make it easier to integrate with popular CSS frameworks, such as Bootstrap, Material Design from Google, and Fabric, which is the design system for Microsoft Office.

## Updates and enhancements

### TinyMCE

The new TinyMCE 5.0.7 editor comes with significant changes to the previous versions. Improved solutions have been introduced for unnecessary and obsolete configuration options. A comprehensive list of the updates and fixed issues is available in the [changelog]({{site.baseurl}}/changelog/#version507june52019).

#### Autocompleter

The autocompleter functionality builtin to TinyMCE and used by the [**Mentions**]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/premium/mentions/), [**Charmap**]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/opensource/charmap/) and [**Emoticons**]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/opensource/emoticons/) plugins, has been improved to highlight matched text results, search across fragmented text nodes and support matching results that contain one or more spaces.

For more information on the autocompleter refer to the [documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/ui-components/autocompleter/).

#### Link plugin

The **Link** plugin `link_assume_external_targets` setting has been improved to allow two additional values: `http` and `https`. Using one of the new values will automatically set the protocol if not defined when creating a link, instead of asking the user if the protocol should be added.

For more information on the configuration options for `link_assume_external_targets` refer to the [documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/opensource/link/#link_assume_external_targets).

## Known issues

### Premium Skins and Icon Packs

Using the cloud hosted premium content skins, in combination with the [preview]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/opensource/preview/) plugin, will cause nothing to render in the preview dialog. This is because the `Origin` header sent to the server is `null`, due to how the preview dialog is implemented in TinyMCE. This will be fixed in the next release of TinyMCE.

> Note: This issue only impacts cloud and does not impact self-hosted installations.

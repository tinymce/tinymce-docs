The following new features and enhancements were added for the {{site.productname}} 5.2 release.

[#alternative-toolbar-and-menu-bar-placement-with-the-setting]

The `toolbar_drawer: false` setting has been deprecated; the behavior is now provided by the `toolbar_mode: 'wrap'` setting.

[#translations-missing-for-new-user-interface-options]
=== Translations missing for new user interface options

[#issue]
==== Issue

New user interface features do not have translations to other supported languages at this time. This includes text related to:

* <<newoptiontoassistwithmarkingimagesasdecorativeforaccessibilitypurposes,The new accessibility settings>>.
* <<checklist110,The new checklist menu item>>.

[#workaround]
==== Workaround

No known workaround at the time of release.

[#floating-toolbar-disconnects-from-the-toolbar-in-inline-mode]
=== Floating toolbar disconnects from the toolbar in inline mode

[#issue-2]
==== Issue

NOTE: This issue will be resolved with the release of {{site.productname}} 5.2.1.

If the editor is set to `inline: true`, and `toolbar_drawer` or `toolbar_mode` is set to `'floating'`, such as:

`js
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',
  inline: true,
  toolbar_drawer: 'floating'
});
`

or

`js
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',
  inline: true,
  toolbar_mode: 'floating'
});
`

The floating component of the toolbar will disconnect from the primary toolbar when additional content is added to the editor, causing the content area to resize (such as adding new lines).

[#workaround-2]
==== Workaround

Set `toolbar_drawer` or `toolbar_mode` to an alternative mode until the issue is resolved. For a list of alternative toolbar modes, see: link:{{site.baseurl}}/configure/editor-appearance/#toolbar_mode[User interface options - `toolbar_mode`].

[#microsoft-internet-explorer-will-incorrectly-auto-focus-the-editor-when-tinymce-is-initialized]
=== Microsoft Internet Explorer will incorrectly auto focus the editor when TinyMCE is initialized

[#issue-2]
==== Issue

NOTE: This issue will be resolved with the release of {{site.productname}} 5.2.1.

When a webpage containing {{site.productname}} is loaded on Microsoft Internet Explorer, the web browser focus will automatically move to the editor when the editor is loaded.

[#workaround-2]
==== Workaround

No known workaround at the time of release.

[#incorrect-positioning-of-inline-dialogs-when-using-sticky-toolbars-and-the-bottom-toolbar]
=== Incorrect positioning of inline dialogs when using sticky toolbars and the bottom toolbar

[#issue-2]
==== Issue

Inline dialogs, such as the _Search and Replace dialog_ and the _Accessibility Checker dialog_, will be positioned incorrectly when sticky toolbar and the bottom toolbar are used together. For example:

`js
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',
  toolbar_sticky: true,
  toolbar_location: 'bottom'
});
`

Custom inline dialogs are also affected.

[#workaround-2]
==== Workaround

To avoid this issue, either:

* Do not use the new `toolbar_location` option until the issue is resolved.
* Set `toolbar_sticky` to `false` before setting `toolbar_location: 'bottom'` until the issue is resolved.

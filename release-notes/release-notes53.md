## TinyMCE 5.3 new features and enhancements

The following new features and enhancements were added for the {{site.productname}} 5.3 release.

### New toolbar location default setting

{{site.productname}} 5.3 includes a new default, `auto`, for the `toolbar_location` option. The `auto` option positions the toolbar and menu bar either:

- Above the content area by default.
- Below the content area if there is not enough space to display the toolbar and menu bar above.

This new default setting has been added to improve the user experience for the editor in inline mode.

For information on:

- The `toolbar_location` option, see: [User interface options - toolbar_location]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/editor-appearance/#toolbar_location).
- {{site.productname}} in inline mode, see: [Setup inline editing mode]({{site.baseurl}}/general-configuration-guide/use-tinymce-inline/#enablinginlineeditingmode).

### Moved the 'enabled' checkmark on toggle menu items to the right-hand side

The checkmark on toggle menu items that indicates that an option is enabled, has been moved. The checkmark will now appear to the right of the menu label. This change provides clearer feedback to users and allows icons to be added to toggle menu items.
For example:

| {{site.productname}} 5.2 toggle menu item checkmark behavior | {{site.productname}} 5.3 toggle menu item checkmark behavior |
| :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| ![Custom toggle menu item with checkmark on the left-hand side of the item label (pre-5.3 behavior)]({{site.baseurl}}/images/old_togglemenuitemchecked.png) | ![Custom toggle menu item with checkmark on the right-hand side of the item label (5.3+ behavior)]({{site.baseurl}}/images/53_togglemenuitemchecked.png) |

For information on toggle menu items, see: [Custom menu items - Toggle menu items]({{site.baseurl}}/ui-components/menuitems/#togglemenuitems).

### New find and replace in selection functionality

A new "Find in selection" option has been added to the Find and Replace dialog provided by the Search and Replace plugin.

For example:

![Find and Replace dialog with new "Find in selection" option highlighted]({{site.baseurl}}/images/find-replace-in-selection.png)

For information on enabling the Find and Replace dialog, see: [the Search and Replace plugin]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/opensource/searchreplace/).

### Multiple context toolbars can now be concatenated

In situations where more than one context toolbar could be shown, they will be concatenated instead of prioritizing one of the context toolbars. This includes context toolbars provided by the Quick Toolbars plugin.

For information on:

- The Quick Toolbars plugin, see: [The Quick Toolbars plugin]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/opensource/quickbars/).
- Creating custom context toolbars, see: [Context toolbars]({{site.baseurl}}/ui-components/contexttoolbar/).

### New Greek premium language pack

This version requires Java 8 or higher. For information on the removal of Java 7 support, see: [Removal of Java 7 support](#removalofjava7support).

For information on:

- The Spell Checker Pro plugin, see: [Spell Checker Pro plugin]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/premium/tinymcespellchecker/).

### Removal of Java 7 support

Java 7 support has been removed with this release. The {{site.productname}} Java server-side components now require a minimum of Java 8. From the {{site.productname}} 5.3 release, the `.war` files provided in the self-hosted bundles will not be compatible with Java 7. This change resolves security issues present in the older versions of these services. The following plugins are affected by this change:

- SpellChecker Pro (`tinymcespellchecker`) - `ephox-spelling.war` has been updated to version `2.3.0`.
- Image Tools (`imagetools`) - `ephox-image-proxy.war` has been updated to version `2.3.0`.
- Enhanced Media Embed (`mediaembed`) - `ephox-hyperlinking.war` has been updated to version `2.3.0`.
- Link Checker (`linkchecker`) - `ephox-hyperlinking.war` has been updated to version `2.3.0`.

### Pre-configured Dockerfiles for containerizing the server-side components

From {{site.productname}} 5.3, premium self-hosted bundles include the files required to build and deploy the server-side components as Docker containers. For information on Docker deployments of the server-side components, see: [Containerized service deployments]({{site.baseurl}}/enterprise/server/dockerservices/).

For information on deploying the server-side components using Docker, see: [Containerized service deployments]({{site.baseurl}}/enterprise/server/dockerservices/).

### Regular Expression support for allowed-origins

Version 2.3.0 of the {{site.productname}} server-side components adds support for using regular expressions to specify `allowed-origins`. For information on using regular expressions for specifying allowed origins, see: [Configure server-side components - Regular Expressions support]({{site.baseurl}}/enterprise/server/configure/#regularexpressionssupport).

### New configuration option for simplifying same-origin deployments

The new `same-origin` option allows all cross-origin requests to be blocked by the server while allowing all same-origin requests.

For information on configuring the same-origin option, see: [Configure server-side components - allowed-origins.same-origin (optional)]({{site.baseurl}}/enterprise/server/configure/#allowed-originssame-originoptional).

### New alternative http timeout settings

Three new http timeout settings have been added to the server-side components. These new settings provide greater control over the timeout length of requests that the existing `request-timeout-seconds` configuration setting.

For information on configuring the alternative http timeout settings, see: [Configure server-side components - Alternative http timeout settings]({{site.baseurl}}/enterprise/server/configure/#alternativehttptimeoutsettings).

### New `fallback-to-get` setting for the Link Checker service

The new `fallback-to-get` configuration setting allows the Link checker can correctly identify working URLs that return non-standard `HEAD` replies.

For information on configuring the Link Checker service, see: [Configure server-side components - `link-checking`]({{site.baseurl}}/enterprise/server/configure/#link-checkingoptional)

## Minor changes for TinyMCE 5.3

{{site.productname}} 5.3 introduces the following minor changes:

* Added `uploadUri` and `blobInfo` to the data returned by `editor.uploadImages()`.
* Added a new function to the `BlobCache` API to lookup a blob based on the base64 data and mime type.
* Added `icon` as an optional config option to the toggle menu item API.
* Changed the `link`, `image`, and `paste` plugins to use Promises to reduce the bundle size.
* Changed the default icons to be lazy loaded during initialization.
* Changed the parsing of content so base64 encoded urls are converted to blob urls.
* Changed context toolbars so they concatenate when more than one is suitable for the current selection.
* Changed inline style element formats (strong, b, em, i, u, strike) to convert to a span on format removal if a `style` or `class` attribute is present.

## General bug fixes

{{site.productname}} 5.3 provides fixes for the following bugs:

* Fixed the image upload error alert also incorrectly closing the image dialog.
* Fixed the `selection.setContent()` API not running parser filters.
* Fixed formats incorrectly applied or removed when table cells were selected.

* Fixed resize handlers displaying in the wrong location sometimes for remote images.
* Fixed table picker breaking in Firefox on low zoom levels.

* Fixed `ObjectResized` and `ObjectResizeStart` events incorrectly fired when adding or removing table rows and columns.
* Fixed the placeholder not hiding when pasting content into the editor.
* Fixed an issue where the editor would fail to load if local storage was disabled.
* Fixed an issue where an uploaded image would reuse a cached image with a different mime type.
* Fixed bug where toolbars and dialogs would not show if the body element was replaced (e.g. with Turbolinks). Patch contributed by spohlenz.
* Fixed an issue where multiple formats would be removed when removing a single format at the end of lines or on empty lines.
* Fixed zero-width spaces incorrectly included in the `wordcount` plugin character count.
* Fixed a regression introduced in 5.2.0 whereby the desktop `toolbar_mode` setting would incorrectly override the mobile default setting.
* Fixed an issue where deleting all content in a single cell table would delete the entire table.

## Deprecated features

The `images_dataimg_filter` option has been deprecated with the release of {{site.productname}} 5.3 and may be removed in a future release of {{site.productname}}. This option can be used for an unintended use-case that will likely be incompatible with the future introduction of real-time collaboration support.

For information on:

- The `images_dataimg_filter` option, see: [Image & file options - images_dataimg_filter]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/file-image-upload/#images_dataimg_filter).
- The future introduction of real-time collaboration, see: [Tiny Blueprint - Collaboration needs a clean Slate]({{site.url}}/blog/real-time-collaborative-editing-slate-js/).

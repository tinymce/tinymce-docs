## TinyMCE 5.5 new features and enhancements

The following new features and enhancements were added for the {{site.productname}} 5.5 release.

### New `contextmenu_avoid_overlap` option for controlling the placement of context menus

The new `contextmenu_avoid_overlap` option can be used to prevent context menus from covering the selected node if the node matches the specified [CSS selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors).

For information on the `contextmenu_avoid_overlap` option, see: [User interface options - `contextmenu_avoid_overlap`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/editor-appearance/#contextmenu_avoid_overlap).

### New persistent toolbar option for inline mode

A new `toolbar_persist` option has been added for disabling the automatic show and hide behavior of the toolbar and menu bar for inline editors.

For information on the new persistent toolbar option, see: [User interface options - `toolbar_persist`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/editor-appearance/#toolbar_persist).

### New listbox component for custom dialogs

The new listbox component for custom dialogs is a composite component with a label and a dropdown list of options for users to select from. This component displays a menu-like dropdown and allows nested options to be shown to users.

For information on the listbox dialog component, see: [Dialog components - listbox]({{site.baseurl}}/ui-components/dialogcomponents/#listbox).

### The toolbar drawer can now be controlled using commands

A new editor command (`execCommand('ToggleToolbarDrawer')`) and editor state query (`queryCommandState('ToggleToolbarDrawer')`) have been added. The command allows the Toolbar Drawer (which holds excess toolbar buttons) to be opened and closed using editor commands. The current state of the Toolbar Drawer can also be queried.

For information on:

- The Toolbar Drawer, see: [User interface options - `toolbar_mode`]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/editor-appearance/#toolbar_mode).
- Commands and query commands available in {{site.productname}}, see: [Commands Available for TinyMCE]({{site.baseurl}}/advanced/editor-command-identifiers/).

### New line height support in the editor

{{site.productname}} 5.5 now supports adjustable line heights. There is a new `lineheight` button available for toolbars, and a new `lineheight` menu item (included by default in the format menu). There is also a new `LineHeight` editor command to change line height and a `LineHeight` query command value to get the current line height.

For information on:

- The `lineheight` toolbar button, see: [Available Toolbar Buttons - The core toolbar buttons]({{site.baseurl}}/advanced/available-toolbar-buttons/#thecoretoolbarbuttons).
- The `lineheight` menu item, see: [Available Menu Items - The core menu items]({{site.baseurl}}/advanced/available-menu-items/#the-core-menu-items).
- The `LineHeight` editor command, see: [Commands available for {{site.productname}} - Core Editor commands]({{site.baseurl}}/advanced/editor-command-identifiers/#coreeditorcommands).
- The `LineHeight` query command value, see: [Commands available for {{site.productname}} - Available query command values]({{site.baseurl}}/advanced/editor-command-identifiers/#availablequerycommandvalues).

### Added `colgroup` support for tables

A new `table_use_colgroups` option allows `colgroup` and `col` elements to be added to new tables. The `colgroup` and `col` elements can be used to set column widths. Other attributes are not supported in the TinyMCE 5.5 release.

For information on the `table_use_colgroups` option, see: [Table plugin - `table_use_colgroups`]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/table/#table_use_colgroups).

## Accompanying Premium Plugin changes

The following premium plugin updates were released alongside {{site.productname}} 5.5.

### Advanced Code Editor 2.2.0

The {{site.productname}} 5.5 release includes an accompanying release of the **Advanced Code Editor** premium plugin.

**Advanced Code Editor** 2.2.0 adds support for loading the Advanced Code Editor user interface components when the editor is in a ShadowRoot.

For information on the Advanced Code Editor plugin, see: [Advanced Code Editor plugin]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/advcode/).

## Minor changes for TinyMCE 5.5

{{site.productname}} 5.5 introduces the following minor changes:

* Added a TypeScript declaration file to the bundle output for TinyMCE core.
* Added new `table_column_resizing` setting to control how table columns are resized when using the resize bars.
* Added the ability to remove images on a failed upload using the `images_upload_handler` failure callback.
* Added `hasPlugin` function to the editor API to determine if a plugin exists or not.
* Added the ability to use `colgroup` elements in tables.
* Added the ability to delete and navigate HTML media elements without the `media` plugin.
* Added `fullscreen_native` setting to the `fullscreen` plugin to enable use of the entire monitor.
* Added table related oxide variables to the Style API for more granular control over table cell selection appearance.
* Added new APIs to allow for programmatic control of the inline toolbar visibility.
* Added the `origin` property to the `ObjectResized` and `ObjectResizeStart` events, to specify which handle the resize was performed on.
* Added new StyleSheetLoader `unload` and `unloadAll` APIs to allow loaded stylesheets to be removed.
* Added back the ability to use nested items in the `image_class_list`, `link_class_list`, `link_list`, `table_class_list`, `table_cell_class_list`, and `table_row_class_list` settings.
* Changed how CSS manipulates table cells when selecting multiple cells to achieve a semi-transparent selection.
* Changed the `target` property on fired events to use the native event target. The original target for an open shadow root can be obtained using `event.getComposedPath()`.
* Changed the editor to clean-up loaded CSS stylesheets when all editors using the stylesheet have been removed.
* Changed `imagetools` context menu icon for accessing the `image` dialog to use the `image` icon.
* Changed the `editor.insertContent()` and `editor.selection.setContent()` APIs to retain leading and trailing whitespace.
* Changed the `table` plugin `Column` menu to include the cut, copy and paste column menu items.
* Changed the default table styles in the content CSS files to better support the styling options available in the `table` dialog.
* Deprecated the `Env.experimentalShadowDom` flag.

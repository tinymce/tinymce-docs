## New features

The following new features were added for the {{site.productname}} 5.7 release.

### Added support for `table_column_resizing` when inserting and deleting table columns

When inserting or deleting table columns, the resizing behavior will now respect the `table_column_resizing` option:

- `table_column_resizing: 'preservetable'` - The columns will resize to fit the width of the table.
- `table_column_resizing: 'resizetable'` - The table will resize to fit the width of the columns.

For information on the `table_column_resizing` option, see: [Table plugin - `table_column_resizing`]({{ site.baseurl }}/plugins/opensource/table/#table_column_resizing).

### Added new `font_css` option 

The `font_css` option loads the specified font CSS files into both the editable area and the webpage {{site.productname}} is rendered in. This is useful for ensuring that {{site.productname}} UI uses the correct fonts for font family examples and for content that uses those fonts, or for ensuring {{site.productname}} content and content outside the editor that should use the same fonts renders correctly.

For information on the `font_css` option, see: [Content Appearance - `font_css`]({{ site.baseurl }}/configure/content-appearance/#font-css).

## Enhancements

The following enhancements were made for the {{site.productname}} 5.7 release.

### Changes to notifications and popups when the editor is blocked

Notifications opened with the Notifications API will now remain visible when the editor's progress state is set to `true` using the {{ site.productname }} `setProgressState()` API. Additionally, popups within the editor (such as context menus and inline dialogs) will now be closed while the editor's progress state is set to `true`.

For information on:

- The {{ site.productname }} `setProgress()` API, see [Editor API - `setProgressState`]({{ site.baseurl }}/api/tinymce/tinymce.editor/#setprogressstate).
- The Notifications API, see [Create custom notifications]({{ site.baseurl }}/advanced/creating-custom-notifications).

### Table widths are now retained when copying and pasting tables

Tables copied to the clipboard when using the `table` plugin will now correctly retain the width of each column. Additionally, the table width will be correctly adjusted to account for the copied column widths.

### Improved behavior when using `lists` plugin on mixed content

The `lists` plugin has been updated to improve toggling lists on content containing:

- Multiple blocks of text.
- Combinations of existing lists and blocks of text.

### Media live embeds now support video and audio elements

The `media_live_embeds` option now supports rendering live embeds of `audio` and `video` elements while editing content. The elements can now also be resized without having to open a dialog to manually change the size.

For information on the `media_live_embeds` option, see: [Media plugin - `media_live_embeds`]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/opensource/media/#media_live_embeds).

### Enhanced `TableModified` event data

The `TableModified` event now contains additional data which specifies whether the table structure, style, or both were modified.

For information on the `TableModified` event, see: [Table plugin - Events]({{ site.baseurl }}/plugins/opensource/table/#events).

### Added IPv6 URI parsing support

The {{site.productname}} `URI` API now supports parsing IPv6 URLs. This enhancement was a community contribution by dev7355608.

For information on the `URI` API, see: [URI]({{site.baseurl}}/api/tinymce.util/tinymce.util.uri/).

### Additional enhancements

- Added Oxide variables for setting the toolbar background colors for inline and sticky toolbars.
- Added a new `AfterProgressState` event that is fired after `editor.setProgressState` calls complete.

- Changed the z-index of the `setProgressState(true)` throbber so it does not hide notifications.

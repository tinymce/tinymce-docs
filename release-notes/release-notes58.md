## New features

The following new features were added for the {{site.productname}} 5.8 release.

### Improved keyboard navigation for the inline boundary feature

Users can now escape inline elements (such as links and comments) using the `Home`, `End`, `PageUp`, and `PageDown` keys. Due to their unique behavior, `PageUp` and `PageDown` are not available in macOS.

For information on inline boundaries, see: [Content appearance options - Inline boundaries]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/content-appearance/#inline_boundaries).

### Added new `fixed_toolbar_container_target` option

The new `fixed_toolbar_container_target` option allows the inline toolbar to be rendered in a specified `HTMLElement`, similar to the `fixed_toolbar_container` setting. This feature was contributed by [pvrobays](https://github.com/pvrobays).

For information on the `fixed_toolbar_container_target` option, see [User interface options - `fixed_toolbar_container_target`]({{ site.baseurl }}/configure/editor-appearance/#fixed_toolbar_container_target).

### Added support for resizing the editor using the keyboard

Keyboard navigation can now be used to select the editor resize handle. Once it is selected, the arrow keys can be used to resize the editor.

For information on editor resizing, see: [User interface options - Resize]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/editor-appearance#resize).

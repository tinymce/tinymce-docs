## Simplest form of setup to get RTC up and running

This is the most simple way to get the RTC plugin up and running using hard coded values. In a proper setup the document id and secret would be retrieved from your server. This examples also assumes that a JWT provider endpoint exists at '/jwt' see the [JWT authentication]({{site.baseurl}}/rtc/jwt-authentication/) page for details on how to set that up.

```js
const myDocumentId = 'some-document-id';
const mySecretKey = 'your secret ðŸ”‘';

tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',
  plugin: 'rtc',
  rtc_document_details_provider: () => Promise.resolve({ documentId }).
  rtc_encryption_provider: ({documentId, sessionId}) => {
    return Promise.resolve({ key: mySecretKey });
  },
  rtc_token_provider: () => {
    return fetch('/jwt', {
      method: 'POST'
    });
  },
  rtc_snapshot: ({version, html}) => console.log(version, html)
})
```

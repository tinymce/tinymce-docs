## Introduction

{% include misc/rtc-description.md %}

## JSON Web Token based authentication

Some cloud services for {{site.productname}} require setting up JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication. JWTs are a common solution for communicating user authorization with web services. JWTs are used to communicate to {{site.productname}} that the user has been authorized to access {{site.cloudname}} services.

For general information on JWTs, visit: [https://jwt.io/](https://jwt.io/).

For information on using JWT authentication with the RTC plugin, see: [JWT authentication]({{site.baseurl}}/rtc/jwt-authentication/).

## Presence API

The RTC plugin comes with a presence API that enables tracking when users enter/leave the session. The only user information shared over the wire is the user id stored in the JWT `sub` claim. Other details such as the user's full name is resolved locally so the {{site.cloudname}} will never see who is actually connecting. There are currently 8 distinct caret colors which can be assigned to a connecting user. More than 8 users can still connect, but then the colors will be reused.

## End-to-end encryption

The RTC plugin encrypts all content-specific traffic. This means the {{site.productname}} cloud services can not read any data transferred or know who is editing. Content and user data is only available to the page running {{ site.productname }}.

### RTC enabled features

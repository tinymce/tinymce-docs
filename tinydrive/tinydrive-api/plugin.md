The {{site.cloudfilemanager}} {{site.productname}} plugin has an API that enables access to {{site.cloudfilemanager}} from your custom plugins or {{site.productname}} specific integration code. This API is available though the `editor.plugins.tinydrive` property.

## `tinydrive.pick`

The `tinydrive.pick` method enables you to pick files from {{site.cloudfilemanager}} and get the meta data of those files returned in a promise. For a complete list of available settings to pass in to this method check the [Picker settings](#pickersettings) section in this page.

### File Picker Result Format

The `tinydrive.pick` API method will return a promise with object that has a `files` property. This `files` property is an array of files with the following properties.

#### name

The name of the selected file for example `my.jpg`.

#### size

The size in bytes of the selected file.

#### url

The url for the selected file would be in the following format: `https://drive.tiny.cloud/1/<your api key>/<file uuid>`

#### mdate

The modification date for the file in ISO 8601 format for example `2019-02-24T15:00:00Z`

### Interactive example: Using `tinydrive.pick`

{% include live-demo.html id="drive-plugin-pick" %}

## `tinydrive.browse`

The `tinydrive.browse` method enables you to browse your files stored in {{site.cloudfilemanager}} but without the possibility to pick them to be inserted. This might be useful if you want to use {{site.cloudfilemanager}} as a generic file manager. It returns a promise but the promise will only resolve when the {{site.cloudfilemanager}} dialog is closed by using the close button. For a complete list of available settings to pass in to this method check the [Picker settings](#pickersettings) section in this page.

### Interactive example: Using `tinydrive.browse`

{% include live-demo.html id="drive-plugin-browse" %}

## `tinydrive.upload`

The `tinydrive.upload` method enables directly upload blobs to your {{site.cloudfilemanager}} storage. This can be useful when you want to store a file generated by your app.

### Interactive example: Using `tinydrive.upload`

{% include live-demo.html id="drive-plugin-upload" %}

## Picker settings

These settings are available for the [tinydrive.pick](#tinydrivepick) / [tinydrive.browse](#tinydrivebrowse) API methods.

### `filetypes`

This setting enables restricting what types of files you want do display based on [file type]({{site.baseurl}}/tinydrive/introduction/#filetypes) categories. For example if your app needs to insert images only then you can specify `['image']` in the file types array.

**Type:** `Array<string>`

#### Interactive example: Using `filetypes`

{% include live-demo.html id="drive-plugin-pick-images" %}

### `max_image_dimension`

This setting enables constraining the width/height of uploaded images. When this is enabled any images with a higher width or height than the specified amount would be proportionally resized down to the specified maximum dimension.

**Type:** `Number`

#### Example: Using `max_image_dimension`

```js
tinydrive.pick({
  max_image_dimension: 1024
}).then(function (result) {
  console.log(result.files);
});
```
